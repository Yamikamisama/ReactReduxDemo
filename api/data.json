      "title": "Steven Spielberg Hopes the Sequel to DreamWorks is a Hit",
      "content": "<p>You might think that being Steven Spielberg has to be a pretty sweet deal: After all, you are revered as the guy who created <em>Jaws</em>, <em>E.T.</em> and the <em>Jurassic Park</em> series. Everything you touch probably turns to gold, right? Except that&#8217;s not the way things work in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Spielberg announced on Thursday that he is reinventing his long-time movie-making vehicle, formerly known as DreamWorks, by creating a partnership with eBay co-founder turned film producer Jeff Skoll that will be called Amblin Partners.</p>\n<p>The reinvention is also in part a refinancing, since DreamWorks hasn&#8217;t been doing all that well financially in recent years, despite Spielberg&#8217;s fame. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/dreamworks-amblin-steven-spielberg-1201663514/\">According to Variety</a>, Skoll&#8217;s Participant Media has invested $200 million in the new entity, and DreamWorks&#8217; original backers &#8212; Reliance Entertainment of India and Canadian-based film distributor eOne &#8212; have also invested.</p>\n<p>In addition, Spielberg&#8217;s new vehicle <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/steven-spielbergs-dreamworks-relaunches-as-amblin-partners-1450301848\">has signed</a> a debt-financing agreement with JP Morgan for a $500 million line of credit to finance new films and TV productions.</p>\n<p>For the past six years, Spielberg has had a distribution partnership with Disney, but that deal expires next year, and the new entity has signed what is said to be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/business/media/steven-spielberg-and-dreamworks-studios-in-deal-to-form-new-company.html?nytmobile=0&amp;_r=0\">a five-year deal</a> with Universal. For Spielberg, this marks a return to his old stomping grounds &#8212; he got his start at Universal, and made both <em>Jaws</em> and <em>E.T.</em> for the studio.</p>\n<p>Like a startup that can&#8217;t seem to find the right product-market fit, DreamWorks has now been through several iterations over the years. Spielberg originally created it in 1994 as a kind of star vehicle for himself, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, with $500 million in financing from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.</p>\n<p>Although DreamWorks had some big hits and critical successes such as <em>Gladiator</em> and <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>, and its animation arm had a hit with <em>Shrek</em>, the studio also made some expensive bets that didn&#8217;t pan out &#8212; like losing more than $125 million making <em>Sinbad</em>. Geffen <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/08/01/island-could-sink-dreamworks-sale.html\">later said that</a> the studio almost went bankrupt twice.</p>\n<p>Viacom acquired the company in 2006 to beef up its Paramount Pictures movie operation, but was mostly interested in its valuable film library. Two years later Spielberg ended his affiliation with Paramount and Viacom and announced a new version of DreamWorks that was backed by Reliance, which invested about $325 million.</p>\n<p>Since that turnaround, however, the studio has had a fairly mixed track record at the box office, thanks to bombs like <em>I Am Number Four</em> and <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em> &#8212; although it has also had critical successes such as <em>The Help</em>. The company had to seek additional financing from Reliance in 2011, which invested another $200 million.</p>\n<p>That makes the new Amblin Partners &#8212; which has DreamWorks as a separate subsidiary &#8212; the third attempt Spielberg has made to reinvent his original studio. Whether it will be a box-office blockbuster or a bomb remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>(video)</p>\n<p><em>You can follow Mathew Ingram on Twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mathewi\">@mathewi</a>, and read all of his posts <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/mathew-ingram/\">here</a> or via <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/mathew-ingram/feed/\">his RSS feed</a>.

Abrams—the director of the year&#8217;s most highly-anticipated movie, <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>—is understandably worried that the movie may fall short of what have become massive expectations. The sequel, which premieres in Los Angeles tonight before opening nationwide later this week, is projected by industry analysts to make anywhere from $1.5 billion to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/just-how-much-will-the-new-star-wars-movie-make/\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion in global box office</a>.</p>\n<p>Those totals would make the film one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, but coming up short would still make it a very high-grossing disappointment. Steven Spielberg—no stranger to blockbuster films himself as well as a friend and mentor to Abrams—told CBS&#8217; <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CBS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/cbs-212/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CBS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> <em>60 Minutes</em> recently that Abrams is &#8220;terrified&#8221; that <em>The Force Awakens</em> could fail to live up to those expectations.</p>\n<iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-946323f0ef700164e4a71269c7f331f42681c087\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6xLvE/2/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-946323f0ef700164e4a71269c7f331f42681c087\" width=\"545px\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Of course, it comes as no surprise that Abrams—a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/11/star-wars-force-awakens-jj-abrams-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">well-known <em>Star Wars</em> super-fan</a>—would be nervous about the new film&#8217;s box office performance. &#8220;There are moments of just abject terror,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-the-new-force-behind-star-wars/\" target=\"_blank\">Abrams told <em>60 Minutes</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>The Force Awakens</em> is still likely to be the highest-grossing <em>Star Wars</em> film ever, based on actual ticket sales only. But, the film would actually have to make more than $2 billion to top the original 1977 film&#8217;s inflation-adjusted box office haul of $2.016 billion, according to research firm Rentrak. (For what it&#8217;s worth, the highest-grossing film of Abrams&#8217; career so far is 2013&#8217;s <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, another sci-fi franchise sequel that pulled in $467 million globally.)</p>\n<iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-c7c523778b4e15f41e551cdf337212eaf40d659a\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wyuyO/1/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-c7c523778b4e15f41e551cdf337212eaf40d659a\" width=\"545px\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Adding to the pressure that any lifelong <em>Star Wars</em> fan would feel when tasked with moving the franchise forward is the fact that Walt Disney <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DIS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/disney-57/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DIS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> paid $4 billion for franchise-owner Lucasfilm just three years ago and hand-picked the 49-year-old Abrams to take over directing duties from <em>Star Wars</em> creator George Lucas, who continues to serve in an advisory role.</p>\n<p>Disney invested a lot of money in <em>Star Wars</em> with the expectation that the franchise would return that investment many times over.

          "content": "<p>What do Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and J.J. Abrams have in common? Yes, all three are uber-directors. They’ve also all partnered with Kathleen Kennedy, the most prolific female film producer in Hollywood, to make some of their biggest hits. Kennedy, the current head of Lucasfilm and producer of the much-anticipated next installation of the Star Wars saga, <i>The Force Awakens</i>, is <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/10/kathleen-kennedy-lucasfilm-star-wars/\">profiled in <i>Fortune’s</i> recent Most Powerful Women issue</a>. She has made dozens of movies over a nearly four-decades-long career (some of her blockbusters include <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, and <i>Schindler&#8217;s List</i>). Collectively, her films have raked in more than $11 billion in worldwide box-office sales and garnered 120 Academy Award nominations.</p>\n<p>What is the secret to her success and her fruitful moviemaking partnerships over the years? In interviews with <i>Fortune</i>, her uber-director other halves weigh in:</p>\n<p><strong>Spielberg:</strong> &#8220;I never felt that being a woman held Kathy back at a time when men clearly held most of the jobs as producers. She didn’t conform or change her approach to people in order to get ahead. What got her ahead is that she has a talent for storytelling and for problem solving. And for getting people to listen to her. A good producer is somebody that has the director’s ear, and that can take the temperature of not just me but also the actors. They know when there’s a problem ahead and are able to stop it before it ever becomes a problem. Kathy’s got great sonar about all the bumps in the road.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lucas</strong>: &#8220;It was obvious that she knew what she was doing right from the get-go, she&#8217;s very strong and she&#8217;s very ambitious. She got those opportunities [to work on multiple big-budget films] because she was really the best person for the job. It was [also] that point in the movie business where you had a lot of people who were just young kids, and so you gave people chances because there were no old people to tell you that you can&#8217;t. I mean, the whole thing in the &#8217;70s was about all the young kids being in charge. She ended up with a huge amount of experience producing films.”</p>\n<p><strong>Abrams:</strong> &#8220;Kathy is so utterly in her element on set, so at ease, so enjoying it, that you can&#8217;t help but feel better whenever she is around. One of Kathy&#8217;s seemingly limitless skills is her incredible ability to delegate and hire people she can trust and communicate with, and then let them do their job. She is constantly giving suggestions, helping course correct, but like anyone with as vast a responsibility as Kathy has, she assembles and helps lead a wonderful team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>For more about Star Wars, watch this Fortune video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"2\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4448907028001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4448907028001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1F0r7TD\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcrimsonpeak%2Cdisneyboxofficeprojections%2Cdisneyboxofficerecords%2Centertainmentnews%2Chowdisneycouldbeatuniversal%2Chowwillstarwarsdowhenitreleases%2Cmovienews%2Csisters%2Cstarwars%2Cstarwarsboxofficeprojections%2Ctheforceawakens%2Cuniversalboxofficerecords%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dstarwarsboxofficeprojections&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

Well, no, probably not. As <em>the Journal</em> points out, Universal likely wants to keep Spielberg close and happy as it looks to follow up on the success of <em>Jurassic World</em> with a sequel planned for 2018. Released in early June, the dino thriller has raked in more than $1.6 billion in worldwide ticket sales and has become the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/jurassic-world-fastest-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">fastest movie ever</a> to cross the $1 billion threshold, doing so in just 13 days.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"3\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4455104125001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4455104125001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1PNS8JP\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Danchorman2%2Cepix%2Chulu%2Chulumakesdealwithepix%2Cinterstellar%2Clionsgate%2Cmgm%2Cmockingjaypart1%2Cmovies%2Cmultiyeardeal%2Cnetflix%2Cnetlfixdropsepix%2Cnetworktvseries%2Cnonexclusivedeal%2Cparamount%2Cstreamingsite%2Csubscribers%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dhulu&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As executive producer of <em>Jurassic World, </em>Spielberg commanded a hefty cut of the profits &#8220;worth tens of millions of dollars,&#8221; according to <em><a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielbergs-dreamworks-split-disney-819594\" target=\"_blank\">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>. So there is certainly plenty of money to be made by the filmmaker from a happy partnership with Universal, which also owns part of other past Spielberg vehicles such as the <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em> franchises (the latter of which also featured Spielberg as executive producer only), either of which could also be ripe for a reboot.</p>\n<p>A new distribution deal could also pump some life into DreamWorks studios, which last month reported losses of $95 million through the first half of the year, while its stock price has dropped more than 22% since the beginning of the summer. The studio partnered with Disney in 2009 following a short-lived and unsuccessful tenure as a division of Viacom&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DIS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/disney-57/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DIS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Paramount Pictures. Should the reported distribution deal with Universal go through, it would be the third major film studio, out of six, to either own or partner with DreamWorks. (<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> also notes that DreamWorks&#8217; potential distribution deal with Universal could also include roughly $400 million in financing from the larger studio and other investors that include Participant Media and Reliance Entertainment.)</p>\n<p>Working with Disney, DreamWorks has struggled to turn out successful films, mixing the occasional success — including award-winners <em>The Help</em> and the Spielberg-directed <em>Lincoln</em> — with more forgettable fare like 2011&#8217;s <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em>. The two remaining films set for release under DreamWorks&#8217; agreement with Disney are Spielberg&#8217;s <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, which stars Tom Hanks and hits theaters in October, and next year&#8217;s <em>The BFG</em>, which Spielberg is adapting from the Roald Dahl book.</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>Call it opening night jitters.</p>\n<p>J.J. Abrams—the director of the year&#8217;s most highly-anticipated movie, <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>—is understandably worried that the movie may fall short of what have become massive expectations. The sequel, which premieres in Los Angeles tonight before opening nationwide later this week, is projected by industry analysts to make anywhere from $1.5 billion to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/just-how-much-will-the-new-star-wars-movie-make/\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion in global box office</a>.</p>\n<p>Those totals would make the film one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, but coming up short would still make it a very high-grossing disappointment. Steven Spielberg—no stranger to blockbuster films himself as well as a friend and mentor to Abrams—told CBS&#8217; <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CBS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/cbs-212/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CBS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> <em>60 Minutes</em> recently that Abrams is &#8220;terrified&#8221; that <em>The Force Awakens</em> could fail to live up to those expectations.</p>\n<iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-946323f0ef700164e4a71269c7f331f42681c087\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6xLvE/2/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-946323f0ef700164e4a71269c7f331f42681c087\" width=\"545px\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Of course, it comes as no surprise that Abrams—a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/11/star-wars-force-awakens-jj-abrams-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">well-known <em>Star Wars</em> super-fan</a>—would be nervous about the new film&#8217;s box office performance. &#8220;There are moments of just abject terror,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-the-new-force-behind-star-wars/\" target=\"_blank\">Abrams told <em>60 Minutes</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>The Force Awakens</em> is still likely to be the highest-grossing <em>Star Wars</em> film ever, based on actual ticket sales only. But, the film would actually have to make more than $2 billion to top the original 1977 film&#8217;s inflation-adjusted box office haul of $2.016 billion, according to research firm Rentrak. (For what it&#8217;s worth, the highest-grossing film of Abrams&#8217; career so far is 2013&#8217;s <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, another sci-fi franchise sequel that pulled in $467 million globally.)</p>\n<iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-c7c523778b4e15f41e551cdf337212eaf40d659a\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wyuyO/1/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-c7c523778b4e15f41e551cdf337212eaf40d659a\" width=\"545px\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>Adding to the pressure that any lifelong <em>Star Wars</em> fan would feel when tasked with moving the franchise forward is the fact that Walt Disney <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DIS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/disney-57/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DIS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> paid $4 billion for franchise-owner Lucasfilm just three years ago and hand-picked the 49-year-old Abrams to take over directing duties from <em>Star Wars</em> creator George Lucas, who continues to serve in an advisory role.</p>\n<p>Disney invested a lot of money in <em>Star Wars</em> with the expectation that the franchise would return that investment many times over. After <em>The Force Awakens</em>, Disney has <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/07/13/star-wars-movies-disney/\" target=\"_blank\">at least four more sequels and spin-offs</a> planned for the next several years—all of which could bring in more than $5 billion total, at least—while the related merchandise, which includes toys and other products, is expected to result in roughly $5 billion in sales in 2016 alone.</p>\n<p>The franchise is a giant business and a box office flop for the first <em>Star Wars</em> released under the Disney umbrella could have a domino effect that would weigh on sales of related products and hurting the overall return on investment for the &#8220;Mouse House.&#8221; In other words, Abrams will have more than just irate fanboys on his back if <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> turns out to be a disappointment, so it&#8217;s no wonder the director is feeling the pressure.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"3\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4462843164001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4462843164001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1YfamXX\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Ddisney%2Chowigotstarted%2Clucasfilm%2Cmichallevram%2Cstarwars%2Cstarwarsepisodeviitheforceawakens%2Cstarwarstoys%2Ctoys%2Cunboxing%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dstarwars&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

              "content": "<p>What do Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and J.J. Abrams have in common? Yes, all three are uber-directors. They’ve also all partnered with Kathleen Kennedy, the most prolific female film producer in Hollywood, to make some of their biggest hits. Kennedy, the current head of Lucasfilm and producer of the much-anticipated next installation of the Star Wars saga, <i>The Force Awakens</i>, is <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/10/kathleen-kennedy-lucasfilm-star-wars/\">profiled in <i>Fortune’s</i> recent Most Powerful Women issue</a>. She has made dozens of movies over a nearly four-decades-long career (some of her blockbusters include <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, and <i>Schindler&#8217;s List</i>). Collectively, her films have raked in more than $11 billion in worldwide box-office sales and garnered 120 Academy Award nominations.</p>\n<p>What is the secret to her success and her fruitful moviemaking partnerships over the years? In interviews with <i>Fortune</i>, her uber-director other halves weigh in:</p>\n<p><strong>Spielberg:</strong> &#8220;I never felt that being a woman held Kathy back at a time when men clearly held most of the jobs as producers. She didn’t conform or change her approach to people in order to get ahead. What got her ahead is that she has a talent for storytelling and for problem solving. And for getting people to listen to her. A good producer is somebody that has the director’s ear, and that can take the temperature of not just me but also the actors. They know when there’s a problem ahead and are able to stop it before it ever becomes a problem. Kathy’s got great sonar about all the bumps in the road.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Lucas</strong>: &#8220;It was obvious that she knew what she was doing right from the get-go, she&#8217;s very strong and she&#8217;s very ambitious. She got those opportunities [to work on multiple big-budget films] because she was really the best person for the job. It was [also] that point in the movie business where you had a lot of people who were just young kids, and so you gave people chances because there were no old people to tell you that you can&#8217;t. I mean, the whole thing in the &#8217;70s was about all the young kids being in charge. She ended up with a huge amount of experience producing films.”</p>\n<p><strong>Abrams:</strong> &#8220;Kathy is so utterly in her element on set, so at ease, so enjoying it, that you can&#8217;t help but feel better whenever she is around. One of Kathy&#8217;s seemingly limitless skills is her incredible ability to delegate and hire people she can trust and communicate with, and then let them do their job.

Well, no, probably not. As <em>the Journal</em> points out, Universal likely wants to keep Spielberg close and happy as it looks to follow up on the success of <em>Jurassic World</em> with a sequel planned for 2018. Released in early June, the dino thriller has raked in more than $1.6 billion in worldwide ticket sales and has become the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/jurassic-world-fastest-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">fastest movie ever</a> to cross the $1 billion threshold, doing so in just 13 days.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"5\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4455104125001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4455104125001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1PNS8JP\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Danchorman2%2Cepix%2Chulu%2Chulumakesdealwithepix%2Cinterstellar%2Clionsgate%2Cmgm%2Cmockingjaypart1%2Cmovies%2Cmultiyeardeal%2Cnetflix%2Cnetlfixdropsepix%2Cnetworktvseries%2Cnonexclusivedeal%2Cparamount%2Cstreamingsite%2Csubscribers%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dhulu&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As executive producer of <em>Jurassic World, </em>Spielberg commanded a hefty cut of the profits &#8220;worth tens of millions of dollars,&#8221; according to <em><a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielbergs-dreamworks-split-disney-819594\" target=\"_blank\">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>. So there is certainly plenty of money to be made by the filmmaker from a happy partnership with Universal, which also owns part of other past Spielberg vehicles such as the <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em> franchises (the latter of which also featured Spielberg as executive producer only), either of which could also be ripe for a reboot.</p>\n<p>A new distribution deal could also pump some life into DreamWorks studios, which last month reported losses of $95 million through the first half of the year, while its stock price has dropped more than 22% since the beginning of the summer. The studio partnered with Disney in 2009 following a short-lived and unsuccessful tenure as a division of Viacom&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DIS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/disney-57/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DIS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Paramount Pictures. Should the reported distribution deal with Universal go through, it would be the third major film studio, out of six, to either own or partner with DreamWorks. (<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> also notes that DreamWorks&#8217; potential distribution deal with Universal could also include roughly $400 million in financing from the larger studio and other investors that include Participant Media and Reliance Entertainment.)</p>\n<p>Working with Disney, DreamWorks has struggled to turn out successful films, mixing the occasional success — including award-winners <em>The Help</em> and the Spielberg-directed <em>Lincoln</em> — with more forgettable fare like 2011&#8217;s <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em>. The two remaining films set for release under DreamWorks&#8217; agreement with Disney are Spielberg&#8217;s <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, which stars Tom Hanks and hits theaters in October, and next year&#8217;s <em>The BFG</em>, which Spielberg is adapting from the Roald Dahl book.</p>\n",

Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said the deal looked smart but could divide investors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While significant clinical and commercial risks remain, the transaction could ultimately prove a stroke of genius, adding a multibillion-dollar potential drug launch in 2017 that could accelerate AstraZeneca&#8217;s re-emergence as a major force in oncology,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Acalabrutinib works in a similar way to AbbVie and Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s product Imbruvica. But AstraZeneca believes the new medicine, which is now in final-stage testing, could be best-in-class, since it has fewer side effects than Imbruvica and potentially better efficacy. Other rival drugs are further behind in development.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca will pay $2.5 billion upfront, funded from cash and debt, with a further $1.5 billion paid either on receipt of the first regulatory approval for acalabrutinib or at the end of 2018, depending on which comes first.</p>\n<p>Acerta shareholders will have the option to sell the remaining 45% of shares in the biotech company to AstraZeneca for approximately $3 billion, once acalabrutinib has been approved in both the United States and Europe.</p>\n<p>Acalabrutinib is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval in the second half of 2016.</p>\n<p>Soriot said the deal was consistent with his drive to build up the cancer business, although he did not expect to buy in many more oncology assets.</p>\n<p>The new medicine is a so-called Burton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets an array of blood cancers and potentially some solid tumors. It may also help in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.</p>\n<p>Adding Acerta boosts AstraZeneca&#8217;s pipeline as sales of older blockbuster products, including cholesterol fighter Crestor and heartburn pill Nexium, lose patent protection and it marks the latest in a run of bolt-on acquisitions.</p>\n<p>Last month AstraZeneca agreed to buy ZS Pharma, a specialist in treating high potassium levels, for $2.7 billion and on Wednesday it clinched a deal to pay $575 million for Takeda&#8217;s respiratory business.</p>\n<p>The Acerta agreement, which is due to complete in the first quarter of 2016, is expected to dilute earnings &#8220;moderately&#8221; in the near term, AstraZeneca said.</p>\n<p>The drugmaker had announced on Monday that it was exploring potential strategic options with Acerta, which is based in the Netherlands and California.</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs and Jefferies advised Acerta. AstraZeneca declined to provide details on its advisers.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"4\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4592920750001-4\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4592920750001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1NVeF9s\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcancerresearch%2Cdavidagus%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cprofessorofmedicineandengineering%2Cuniversityofsoutherncalifornia%2Cusccenterforappliedmolecularmedicine%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

It now expects the latest Surface devices to be the fastest-adopted ever by enterprise customers. But then again, what else would it say?</p>\n<p>As part of a<a href=\"http://blogs.windows.com/devices/2015/10/20/surface-pro-4-is-the-fastest-surface-adopted-in-business-ever/\"> new enterprise sales program,</a> Microsoft will let companies aggregate or pool warranty claims across devices rather than locking a limited number warranty calls to a particular unit. &#8220;You get 2,000 claims on 1,000 machines and can divvy them out as needed,&#8221; Cyril Belikoff, director of Surface, told Fortune.</p>\n<p>And since these are factory-sealed devices that cannot be stripped of their hard drives, it is also letting companies destroy problematic units and get a full replacement, via next-day air shipment. Typically, misbehaving devices must be sent back to the manufacturer.</p>\n<p>BNY Mellon, The Carlyle Group, AstraZeneca, Land O&#8217; Lakes, and the Global Fund are just some of the clients Microsoft says have purchased Surface hardware.</p>\n<p>One of the devices&#8217; big selling points is that they come from Microsoft, and thus will run the cash-cow Office applications well and fit into the Microsoft-centric infrastructure of many companies. And, given Microsoft&#8217;s promise that the new Windows 10 will run across these devices, larger PCs and phones may resonate in these accounts.</p>\n<p>David Austin, chief technology officer of Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, is sold on Surface — no disrespect to Apple.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple makes great stuff but it&#8217;s hard to integrate that into my Microsoft environment,&#8221; Austin told Fortune. Sales and service people at the company&#8217;s 80 auto dealerships will use Surface devices to show customers options, pull up visualizations, run calculations on the showroom floor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The other component that&#8217;s profoundly cool to us is that with Surface, I really get a desktop and a tablet out of it while we could not run an iPad as a desktop,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;Keeping everything in one ecosystem is a plus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Microsoft has big challenges in hardware. It&#8217;s now competing with its largest hardware partners, for example, virtually all of which have their own tablets and laptops to sell.</p>\n<p>Last month, Hewlett-Packard <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"HPQ\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/hp-19/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">HPQ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/move-over-surface-pro-4-dell-challenges-with-new-xps-12/\">Dell</a> said they would <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/09/ipad-envy-prompted-microsoft-surface-alliance/\">offer previously-announced Surface devices </a>to their business customers, but why they would sell them over their own units is unclear. Not all PC makers are so open minded regarding Surface devices — Lenovo reportedly <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/15/lenovo_says_no_to_microsoft_surface/\">passed on the opportunity</a> to sell the device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can expect HP and Dell to continue to evaluate new devices as part of the partnerships announced last month,&#8221; a Microsoft spokesperson said via email.</p>\n<p>It may be difficult to stem the flow of Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> iPads and iPhones into corporate accounts, even Microsoft shops.

The patriotism angle I get, but then again, why blame corporate chiefs for taking advantage of tax games that are perfectly legal, especially in a rapidly globalizing economy?</p>\n<p>The big mystery is why it took some companies so long to do this, and why many others have held back, at least so far?</p>\n<p>My personal best guess is that until recently, many corporate leaders had some faith that this would be the year of major corporate tax overhaul. That faith eroded with the retirements of two tax committee chairs (Former Sen. Max Baucus, who went to China as U.S. Ambassador, and U.S. Republican Congressman Dave Camp of Michigan, who is leaving at the end of this year). In addition, companies doing or contemplating inversions want to get them done before they are handcuffed by Congress (or so they may think).</p>\n<p>The amounts at stake are still small by government standards (though not by corporate standards). The <a href=\"http://newsletters.usdbriefs.com/2014/Tax/TNV/140530_2.pdf.\">Joint Tax Committee</a> has estimated that legislation aimed at stopping inversions would prevent the U.S. Treasury from losing roughly $2 billion a year, a drop in the bucket compared to federal corporate tax revenues of $333 billion in fiscal 2014 (and an even smaller share of total federal tax receipts of <a href=\"http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/us_income_tax_revenue_10.html\">$3 trillion in that year</a>).</p>\n<p>The problem is if Congress does nothing to bring down corporate tax rates, in return for narrowing or eliminating deductions and credits, inversions will continue, eventually eroding conceivably up to half the revenue from the corporate tax (that’s the latest share of all corporate tax revenue derived from multinational <a href=\"http://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/02-28-2013-multinationaltaxes_one-col.pdf\">companies</a>).</p>\n<p>Obviously alarmed at this possible end game, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asked Congress in a letter this week to take immediate action to prevent inversions, if necessary then retroactively to May (hold that latter thought until the end of this essay).</p>\n<p>There is much sympathy in both political parties for clamping down on inversions. The best known proposal to do this has been drafted by the “Levin brothers” (Sen. Carl Levin and Rep. Sander Levin) and would allow inversions only if the shareholders of the acquiring foreign firm hold a higher share, at least 50%, of the U.S. company after the transaction (the current threshold is just 20%). In addition, the proposal would require management to change, a feature that would probably do most to stop inversions in their tracks.</p>\n<p>But even sympathetic Congressional members will consider anything like the Levins’ proposal only as part of comprehensive corporate tax overhaul, which is all but dead now, especially heading into the mid-term elections.</p>\n<p>As they say, when one gets lemons and doesn’t want them, turn them into lemonade. Think of inversions as the big lemon that just landed in Washington, and lemonade being real comprehensive corporate tax reform.</p>\n<p>This is because Washington has gotten into the unfortunate habit of legislating only in response to a crisis. Up to now, the best argument for corporate tax reform is that it would boost growth over the long-run – a conclusion widely shared across the political aisle, but one that has no immediacy to it. Inversions are a game changer and may be just the sort of crisis that next year could really put corporate tax reform high on the political agenda, regardless of the outcome of the November elections.</p>\n<p>If this is true, then it will sure help the effort if the Administration walks the talk and really backs Congressional efforts to do this. A tax reform package that really lowers “corporate tax expenditures” in return for a markedly lower statutory rate (25 percent may be too ambitious, 28 percent may be more realistic) would be the one bipartisan legislative accomplishment that the President could tout as he leaves office in 2016.</p>\n<p>While we’re discussing crisis-driven legislation, I can’t resist noting that in an ideal world, the current child immigration crisis would be the spark for Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform. Likewise, there would be a crisis – short of another recession – that would spur Congress and a President (if not this one, then next one) to enact a compromise package that would put our nation’s long-term finances on a sustainable path.</p>\n<p>But this is surely dreaming too much. Let’s start with true corporate tax reform. And companies should now be on notice that any inversions they may enter from now on could very well be retroactively undone by tax legislation enacted sometime in the next two and a half years.</p>\n<p><em>Robert Litan is a non-resident senior fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/programs/economics\">Brookings Institution </a>and author of</em> <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118781805.html\">The Trillion Dollar Economists</a>. <em>Follow him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobLitan\">@BobLitan</a><br />\n</em></p>\n",

It now expects the latest Surface devices to be the fastest-adopted ever by enterprise customers. But then again, what else would it say?</p>\n<p>As part of a<a href=\"http://blogs.windows.com/devices/2015/10/20/surface-pro-4-is-the-fastest-surface-adopted-in-business-ever/\"> new enterprise sales program,</a> Microsoft will let companies aggregate or pool warranty claims across devices rather than locking a limited number warranty calls to a particular unit. &#8220;You get 2,000 claims on 1,000 machines and can divvy them out as needed,&#8221; Cyril Belikoff, director of Surface, told Fortune.</p>\n<p>And since these are factory-sealed devices that cannot be stripped of their hard drives, it is also letting companies destroy problematic units and get a full replacement, via next-day air shipment. Typically, misbehaving devices must be sent back to the manufacturer.</p>\n<p>BNY Mellon, The Carlyle Group, AstraZeneca, Land O&#8217; Lakes, and the Global Fund are just some of the clients Microsoft says have purchased Surface hardware.</p>\n<p>One of the devices&#8217; big selling points is that they come from Microsoft, and thus will run the cash-cow Office applications well and fit into the Microsoft-centric infrastructure of many companies. And, given Microsoft&#8217;s promise that the new Windows 10 will run across these devices, larger PCs and phones may resonate in these accounts.</p>\n<p>David Austin, chief technology officer of Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, is sold on Surface — no disrespect to Apple.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple makes great stuff but it&#8217;s hard to integrate that into my Microsoft environment,&#8221; Austin told Fortune. Sales and service people at the company&#8217;s 80 auto dealerships will use Surface devices to show customers options, pull up visualizations, run calculations on the showroom floor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The other component that&#8217;s profoundly cool to us is that with Surface, I really get a desktop and a tablet out of it while we could not run an iPad as a desktop,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;Keeping everything in one ecosystem is a plus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Microsoft has big challenges in hardware. It&#8217;s now competing with its largest hardware partners, for example, virtually all of which have their own tablets and laptops to sell.</p>\n<p>Last month, Hewlett-Packard <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"HPQ\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/hp-19/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">HPQ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/move-over-surface-pro-4-dell-challenges-with-new-xps-12/\">Dell</a> said they would <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/09/ipad-envy-prompted-microsoft-surface-alliance/\">offer previously-announced Surface devices </a>to their business customers, but why they would sell them over their own units is unclear. Not all PC makers are so open minded regarding Surface devices — Lenovo reportedly <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/15/lenovo_says_no_to_microsoft_surface/\">passed on the opportunity</a> to sell the device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can expect HP and Dell to continue to evaluate new devices as part of the partnerships announced last month,&#8221; a Microsoft spokesperson said via email.</p>\n<p>It may be difficult to stem the flow of Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> iPads and iPhones into corporate accounts, even Microsoft shops.

The patriotism angle I get, but then again, why blame corporate chiefs for taking advantage of tax games that are perfectly legal, especially in a rapidly globalizing economy?</p>\n<p>The big mystery is why it took some companies so long to do this, and why many others have held back, at least so far?</p>\n<p>My personal best guess is that until recently, many corporate leaders had some faith that this would be the year of major corporate tax overhaul. That faith eroded with the retirements of two tax committee chairs (Former Sen. Max Baucus, who went to China as U.S. Ambassador, and U.S. Republican Congressman Dave Camp of Michigan, who is leaving at the end of this year). In addition, companies doing or contemplating inversions want to get them done before they are handcuffed by Congress (or so they may think).</p>\n<p>The amounts at stake are still small by government standards (though not by corporate standards). The <a href=\"http://newsletters.usdbriefs.com/2014/Tax/TNV/140530_2.pdf.\">Joint Tax Committee</a> has estimated that legislation aimed at stopping inversions would prevent the U.S. Treasury from losing roughly $2 billion a year, a drop in the bucket compared to federal corporate tax revenues of $333 billion in fiscal 2014 (and an even smaller share of total federal tax receipts of <a href=\"http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/us_income_tax_revenue_10.html\">$3 trillion in that year</a>).</p>\n<p>The problem is if Congress does nothing to bring down corporate tax rates, in return for narrowing or eliminating deductions and credits, inversions will continue, eventually eroding conceivably up to half the revenue from the corporate tax (that’s the latest share of all corporate tax revenue derived from multinational <a href=\"http://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/02-28-2013-multinationaltaxes_one-col.pdf\">companies</a>).</p>\n<p>Obviously alarmed at this possible end game, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asked Congress in a letter this week to take immediate action to prevent inversions, if necessary then retroactively to May (hold that latter thought until the end of this essay).</p>\n<p>There is much sympathy in both political parties for clamping down on inversions. The best known proposal to do this has been drafted by the “Levin brothers” (Sen. Carl Levin and Rep. Sander Levin) and would allow inversions only if the shareholders of the acquiring foreign firm hold a higher share, at least 50%, of the U.S. company after the transaction (the current threshold is just 20%). In addition, the proposal would require management to change, a feature that would probably do most to stop inversions in their tracks.</p>\n<p>But even sympathetic Congressional members will consider anything like the Levins’ proposal only as part of comprehensive corporate tax overhaul, which is all but dead now, especially heading into the mid-term elections.</p>\n<p>As they say, when one gets lemons and doesn’t want them, turn them into lemonade. Think of inversions as the big lemon that just landed in Washington, and lemonade being real comprehensive corporate tax reform.</p>\n<p>This is because Washington has gotten into the unfortunate habit of legislating only in response to a crisis. Up to now, the best argument for corporate tax reform is that it would boost growth over the long-run – a conclusion widely shared across the political aisle, but one that has no immediacy to it. Inversions are a game changer and may be just the sort of crisis that next year could really put corporate tax reform high on the political agenda, regardless of the outcome of the November elections.</p>\n<p>If this is true, then it will sure help the effort if the Administration walks the talk and really backs Congressional efforts to do this. A tax reform package that really lowers “corporate tax expenditures” in return for a markedly lower statutory rate (25 percent may be too ambitious, 28 percent may be more realistic) would be the one bipartisan legislative accomplishment that the President could tout as he leaves office in 2016.</p>\n<p>While we’re discussing crisis-driven legislation, I can’t resist noting that in an ideal world, the current child immigration crisis would be the spark for Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform. Likewise, there would be a crisis – short of another recession – that would spur Congress and a President (if not this one, then next one) to enact a compromise package that would put our nation’s long-term finances on a sustainable path.</p>\n<p>But this is surely dreaming too much. Let’s start with true corporate tax reform. And companies should now be on notice that any inversions they may enter from now on could very well be retroactively undone by tax legislation enacted sometime in the next two and a half years.</p>\n<p><em>Robert Litan is a non-resident senior fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/programs/economics\">Brookings Institution </a>and author of</em> <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118781805.html\">The Trillion Dollar Economists</a>. <em>Follow him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobLitan\">@BobLitan</a><br />\n</em></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Microsoft will provide a customized version of Windows 10 to the Chinese government, the company <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/12/16/bringing-windows-10-to-public-sector-customers-in-china/\">announced</a> on Thursday, as it continues to strengthen its relationship with Chinese regulators.</p>\n<p>The partnership is a major turnaround for Microsoft&#8217;s ambitions in China. In 2014, regulators conducted an <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-china-idUSKBN0FX0TY20140729\">anti-monopoly investigation</a> into the company over Windows&#8217; dominance in the market, and even <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/02/26/why-china-is-making-life-miserable-for-big-u-s-tech/\">banned</a> government purchases of computers running the operating system.</p>\n<p>The custom Chinese version of Windows 10 will be &#8220;government-approved,&#8221; and will include Chinese-selected antivirus software. It will be distributed to Chinese government agencies and certain state-owned companies by C&amp;M Information Technologies, a new Beijing-based venture created specifically for the partnership.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/12/16/bringing-windows-10-to-public-sector-customers-in-china/\">Microsoft&#8217;s blog post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re announcing a new joint venture that will license, deploy, manage and optimize Windows 10 for China’s government agencies and certain state owned enterprises and provide ongoing support and services for these customers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The joint venture is not final, however. Microsoft says it is still subject to regulatory approval. The Chinese body participating in the joint venture is the China Electronics Technology Group. In September, Microsoft worked with CETG to make China&#8217;s top search engine, Baidu, the default homepage and search engine in its Edge browser in the region.</p>\n<p>For Microsoft, the partnership not only secures the company a huge customer likely to spend hundreds of millions of dollars going forward, but also gives the company firm ground in a vast market where many of Microsoft&#8217;s most important vendors—such as <a href=\"http://fortune.com/tag/lenovo/\">Lenovo</a> and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/24/xiaomi-windows-tablet/\">Xiaomi—</a>are based.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says that &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of PCs in China run Windows. However, one concern is that many of those copies are pirated. It&#8217;s very possible that Microsoft will look to work with Chinese regulators to try to crack down on software piracy.</p>\n<p>In September, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"msft\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">msft</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> CEO Satya Nadella <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/china-us-seek-common-ground/\">met with Chinese president Xi Jinping</a> to discuss concerns about intellectual property rights as well as how American tech firms can crack the huge market. Microsoft&#8217;s cloud server service, Azure, <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2014/03/27/azuregainchina/\">set up shop in China last year</a>, partnering with Chinese company 21Vianet.</p>\n<p>The Chinese government can also chalk up its partnership with Microsoft as a win. Recently, Chinese officials have been <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/02/26/why-china-is-making-life-miserable-for-big-u-s-tech/\">publicly concerned</a> about big U.S. tech firms including <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/20/china-secure-smartphone/\">secret backdoors</a> in its software in light of Edward Snowden&#8217;s revelations about the National Security Agency&#8217;s spying programs.</p>\n<p>China removed several U.S. tech firms from government-approved purchase lists earlier this year, and even started to develop its own alternative to Windows, called <a href=\"http://qz.com/505383/a-first-look-at-the-chinese-operating-system-the-government-wants-to-replace-windows/\">NeoKylin</a>. The deal with Microsoft presumably will allow China to inspect its version of Windows 10 to ensure there are no hidden surprises that might compromise state security.</p>\n<p>Recently, it was revealed that China <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-aims-to-build-its-own-secure-smartphones-1447961400\">supports state-owned companies</a> seeking to develop a homegrown secure smartphone operating system.</p>\n<p><em>For more on U.S. tech companies&#8217; relationship with China, watch this Fortune video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"7\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4492977982001-7\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4492977982001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1UEkhq0\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dandrewnusca%2Cchina%2Cchinatechcompanies%2Croberthackett%2Ctechcompanies%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

          "title": "Here's Why Elon Musk and Everyone Else Is Betting Big on AI",
          "content": "<p>Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and fellow tech kingpins committed $1 billion to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/11/open-ai/\">researching artificial intelligence</a>. The group&#8217;s findings would be made available for the world. The possibilities where AI might help include the ability to detect anomalies in images of cells to detect cancer, programming robots that can interact with humans, and building programs that could help teach kids at their pace of learning in a more individual style.</p>\n<p>Behind this feel-good effort is a hint at the priorities of some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. It also provides an understanding of how AI or machine learning, as the technology is often called, has the potential to remake the tech world in the same way the web did in the mid-&#8217;90s.</p>\n<p>Worries about artificial intelligence have sparked headlines exclaiming that AI could bring about the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-could-wipe-out-humanity-when-it-gets-too-clever-as-humans-a6686496.html\">death of humanity</a> as smart machines become so much smarter than us they wipe us out, not out of malice, but because we&#8217;re simply in the way of their own goals. The most optimistic ones focused on the possibility of sex robots that can carry on conversations.</p>\n<p>But in reality, AI has existed for over a decade. It already plays a big role in technologies that we take for granted like Apple&#8217;s Siri personal assistant, IBM&#8217;s Watson <em>Jeopardy-</em>winning computer, and even the autopilot feature that Tesla <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TSLA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/tesla-motors-717/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TSLA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> rolled out in its cars earlier this year.</p>\n<p>And before AI can destroy humanity, or provide sexual satisfaction, it has to get better. Much better. And the launch of OpenAI, the billion-dollar nonprofit research center announced this week, opens a window into what some of the big thinkers in computer science and business consider as opportunities and challenges.</p>\n<p>First, as analyst Ben Thompson, who writes over at the site Stratechery, pointed out in an <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/openai-artificial-intelligence-and-data-data-and-recruiting/\">essay about the topic</a>, OpenAI&#8217;s creation can be read as a manifesto, or as a recruiting ad for top research talent.</p>\n<p>Thompson looked past the do-gooder language of the OpenAI blog post, which talks about ensuring that commercial interests don&#8217;t hijack the promise of artificial intelligence research. Instead, he focused on the final line of the third paragraph of the introduction, which reads &#8220;We hope this is what matters most to the best in the field.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The fear is that Google<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, Facebook<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook-242/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and Chinese search engine Baidu <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BIDU\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/bidu/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BIDU</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> are luring all of the machine learning talent to their companies using a sales pitch that hires can work on some of the most complex social problems of our era. Each company uses huge pools of data to help train sophisticated machine learning algorithms.</p>\n<p>Data is the lifeblood of AI. To train computers to learn more like humans, you have to feed them tens of thousands of examples of something. Depending on what type of outcome you are hoping for, the examples can be photos, maps, or words. The computers try to understand what elements of those examples define what makes a cat a cat in an image or what gives meaning to a certain word. The algorithm then gives a statistical weight to each guess that helps the computer &#8220;learn&#8221; what the right answer is. The computer scientist helps train the algorithm by giving feedback and more examples along the way.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why none of these companies ever wants to throw away data. It may come in handy for AI training someday. And that&#8217;s why the promise of using something like Tesla&#8217;s car data for building algorithms might be enough to get a researcher excited to work with OpenAI instead of Google.</p>\n<p>Sam Altman, a co-chair at OpenAI, tells <em>Fortune</em> that data from Tesla would be made available to researchers working at OpenAI. He said he would also work to make data from startups that go through Y Combinator, the accelerator program he leads, available for researchers at OpenAI as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are also plenty of publicly available data sets on the Internet,&#8221; Altman said. Researchers could use those to come up with new tools and algorithms that will advance AI as well.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4380912836001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4380912836001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P3xWVa\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dai%2Caistrikes%2Caiwar%2Caiwarfare%2Cartificialintelligence%2Cartificialintelligencewar%2Cdronebombing%2Cdronestrike%2Cdronestrikemiddleeast%2Cdronestrikes%2Celonmusk%2Cmilitarydrones%2Cstephenhawking%2Cstevewozniak%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dartificialintelligence&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second element designed to attract talent to OpenAI is its nonprofit status and its pledge of openness. It&#8217;s not that Facebook and others aren&#8217;t open with their research. They publish their research fairly quickly. Google, however, tends to wait until it has gained a significant strategic advantage from a new findings before publishing. But it is still made public.</p>\n<p>Serkan Piantino, director of Facebook&#8217;s AI research program, emphasized the importance of openness in a conference call ahead of premiering his company&#8217;s new servers designed <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/facebook-ai-big-sur/\">especially for training computers to learn</a> earlier this month. Facebook&#8217;s engineers expect the work they do to be contributed back to the open source community. Thus, Facebook contributes code to the community in part because that keeps its civic-minded engineers happy.</p>\n<p>But the race for talent isn&#8217;t the only reason OpenAI exists. The development of true artificial intelligence is going to remake software. And every business wants to be part of that shift.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way software is eating the world today, well, AI will do that to software,&#8221; says Amir Husain, CEO of Spark Cognition, an AI security startup in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>He explained that many kinds of business software that replaced paper documents and in filing cabinets will eventually be transformed into a new format. And that format will likely be more user-friendly because of hard work done by artificial intelligence behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All of these categories will be destroyed and remade, so there&#8217;s a lot of economic potential locked up in this,&#8221; says Husain. &#8220;It&#8217;s sort of like being the only guy in 1995 who knows HTML.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And that, more than anything, is why the big brains in Silicon Valley and at other companies left out of the OpenAI effort are hustling to stake a claim in this space. Rob High, an IBM Fellow, and VP and CTO of IBM&#8217;s Watson Group, explained that the computing giant is interested in learning more about the organization and getting involved.</p>\n<p>IBM, which learned about the OpenAI group on Friday like nearly everyone else, has a decades-long program in artificial intelligence through Watson. The company hopes that it will help it weather the shift from web-based software to new A.I.-related services.</p>\n<p>But IBM <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"IBM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm-24/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">IBM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> is also building an entirely new type of chip designed for artificial intelligence modeled on the human brain, called a synaptic chip. As far as hardware for AI goes, IBM is the most serious player in the space.</p>\n<p>Following is Nvidia<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NVDA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/nvidia-553/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NVDA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, which makes graphics processors that are actually the preferred chip used today for training computers to learn.</p>\n<p>That gets us back to Altman, from OpenAI, and the plans for the nonprofit. The short-term goals, he said are to build tools and algorithms that will be shared publicly. But in the long term, better hardware is needed to build AI that can perform more like a human.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you think about building better AI and modeling it after the human brain, more hardware research and better hardware will be important,&#8221; Altman says. &#8220;But today that is not our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That might be why Altman says OpenAI only spoke very casually with a person who was involved with Watson at IBM, instead of going through formal channels to try to get Big Blue involved with the project. (And why IBM found no record of someone from OpenAI contacting it at all). Or perhaps there&#8217;s simply a divide between the Silicon Valley practice of calling anything with machine learning involved AI and promoting its involvement in new product launches. Meanwhile, IBM, which brands all of its AI efforts under Watson and cognitive computing, may have confused the public.</p>\n<p>Plenty of other companies have their own efforts in artificial intelligence. For example, Apple has hired researchers, but has reportedly found it to be tough to recruit experts. In part, it&#8217;s because the company <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-29/apple-s-secrecy-hurts-its-ai-software-development\">doesn&#8217;t want to share the research results</a>. Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> also has AI research in natural language for its Skype translation efforts and computer recognition that are worth mentioning as well.</p>\n<p>This is a cheaper way to solve the problem and more Amazon-like. Outside of the giant tech firms, startups, industrial giants, researchers and more are all experimenting with using AI. If OpenAI really does build broadly useful tools, that could help advance science for everyone.</p>\n<p>Altman says it&#8217;s too soon to list OpenAI&#8217;s research priorities. It will work on tools and algorithms, but the specific areas where it will focus are unsure. But he said he would consider it a success if the organization, within one year, publishes &#8220;some seminal paper that drives the state of the art forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s clear that technologists supporting the project and those working on AI in general, have much larger goals.</p>\n<p><em>For more on artificial intelligence, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"9\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4587395234001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4587395234001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P3xWVa\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dai%2Cartificialintelligence%2Cblakeirving%2Ccyphyworks%2Cdrones%2Cebay%2Cetsy%2Cgodaddy%2Cgrokker%2Chelengreiner%2Cirobot%2Ckatrinalake%2Ckristinasalen%2Clarsbjork%2Clornaborenstein%2Cnewyorkstockexchange%2Cnyse%2Cqlik%2Cquentinclark%2Crjpittman%2Csap%2Cstitchfix%2Cstitchfix%2Ctechcetera%2Ctomfarley%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechcetera&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><span class=\"\"><i>Make sure to</i><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/philip-elmer-dewitt\"><i> s</i></a><i><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\" target=\"_blank\">ign up for Data Sheet</a>, </i>Fortune’s<i> daily newsletter about the business of technology.</i></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

          "content": "<p>While many consumers still think of Nintendo platforms as kids&#8217; toys, Mercedes-Benz, a division of Daimler AG<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DDAIF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ddaif/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DDAIF</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, is using Nintendo Wii U to market its $32,500 GLA compact SUV to adult gamers across two very different games.</p>\n<p>The German automaker has created a free <em>Super Mario Maker</em> event course called Mercedes-Benz Jump’n’Drive. The course takes players through a variety of automotive-related areas, including being at the dealership, taking a test drive through a city, and cruising down the autobahn. Once players complete the level, they unlock an in-game Mercedes-Benz GLA with Mario in the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>“Many people grew up with <em>Mario</em> during the last 30 years, so there are quite a lot of 30- and 40-somethings around for which <em>Super Mario Maker</em> hails back to their childhood days and gives them a large dose of nostalgia,” says Caroline Pilz, head of product placement and fashion sponsoring for Mercedes-Benz Cars.</p>\n<p>Pilz says the GLA is part of a new generation of compact-class luxury cars aimed at an affluent and progressive audience, making it a good match with a significant part of <em>Super Mario Maker’s</em> target audience.</p>\n<p>This latest initiative expands a relationship between the game maker and automaker that originated last year with a <em>Mario Kart 8</em> integration. Mercedes sponsored free downloadable content (DLC) for the racing game last summer, which includes the 1957 300 SL Roadster sports car, the 1934 W 25 Silver Arrow formula racing car, and the GLA.</p>\n<p>“While we received a lot of positive feedback on the campaign and the integration of our cars into <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, we also learned that many gamers are skeptical about brands appearing in their games,” Pilz says. “So we made sure to put a lot of effort and passion into designing the actual level.”</p>\n<p>Pilz says the great thing about these video game sponsorships is that there’s no fixed limit. As long as Nintendo <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NTDOY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ntdoy/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NTDOY</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> supports these games, the Mercedes-Benz content stays available as free downloadable or unlockable content.</p>\n<p>With these Nintendo deals, Mercedes now connects with gamers across all three consoles. The car company works with Sony <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SNE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/sne/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SNE</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on its <em>Gran Turismo</em> franchise and Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on its <em>Forza Motorsport</em> games, as well as game publishers like Electronic Arts <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/adams-resources-energy-609/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AE</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on <em>Need for Speed</em> and Bandai Namco <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NCBDF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ncbdf/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NCBDF</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on <em>Project Cars</em>.</p>\n<p>“Gaming has been important for our branded entertainment marketing strategy since the integration of the SLS AMG sports car in <em>Gran Turismo 5</em> in 2009,” Pilz says. “Since then, we have intensified our relationships with the gaming industry and executed at least one major marketing partnership per year. Moving forward, there is very likely a growing importance of games, as the global gaming audience is growing older and more diverse, and thus becomes even more relevant to us as a brand.”</p>\n<p>Pilz says the presence in racing games is a good way for Mercedes-Benz to make a young, car-enthusiastic audience familiar with its products.</p>\n<p>“We have managed to raise awareness for the sportiness of the brand, thus making the brand more attractive and relevant for new target groups,” Pilz says.</p>\n<p><em>Nintendo&#8217;s first mobile &#8220;game,&#8221; Miitomo, is due out in spring 2016.

          "title": "What Investors Need to Know About ESports",
          "content": "<p>ESports is big business today, and it’s only just begun.</p>\n<p>The eSports ecosystem, a $278 million industry, could surpass $1 billion as early as 2018, according to research firm Newzoo. The firm estimates there are over 205 million eSports fans globally and that number could grow to over 335 million by 2017.</p>\n<p>With all of these lofty projections, there are investment opportunities in this global video game landscape for those who know where to look. Ashish Mistry, managing partner at private investment firm BLH Venture Partners, knows eSports. His company, KontrolFreek, makes accessories for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers that pro gamers use to get a competitive edge in games like <em>Halo 5: Guardians</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em>.</p>\n<p>Mistry points to opportunities beyond the traditional media buys for live-streamed eSports events across Twitch, YouTube, and the upcoming Turner ELeague with <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. It’s becoming increasingly popular to see a product be the official controller or headset of a live event, which he says is a great way to advertise.</p>\n<p>“One of the most unique opportunities in the live-streaming eSports space is that brands can sponsor players,” Mistry says. “With the way that eSports operates currently, sometimes it makes sense to sponsor a player instead of their team. We see professionals switch teams all the time, and in some cases their name can carry more weight than the team name. Of course, there is also room in the space for brands to sponsor teams, or even a whole gaming league, as well.”</p>\n<p>While eSports has its roots in PC gaming, big companies like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/05/microsoft-halo-5-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/09/activision-call-of-duty-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Activision Publishing</a><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ATVI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/activision-blizzard-585/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ATVI</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/capcom-street-fighter-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Capcom</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CCOEF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ccoef/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CCOEF</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> have been investing in growing the console market with games like <em>Halo 5, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em>, and <em>Street Fighter IV. </em>Separately, companies like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/23/vainglory-mobile-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Evil Megacorp</a> and Blizzard Entertainment have introduced eSports to mobile gamers through <em>Vainglory</em> and <em>Hearthstone.</em></p>\n<p>Mistry says these investments in the eSports market are starting to open up to broader audiences. This will make room for more players, teams, and brands.</p>\n<p>“The first NASCAR sponsors were car-related brands such as Goodyear, Valvoline, and others,” Mistry says. “Once those blocks were in place and money started coming in, brands like Coke and Sharpie were able to justify investing in the sport to sponsor teams and cars. I see the same thing happen with eSports.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/30/coke-expands-esports-reach/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KO\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/coca-cola-63/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KO</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> was one of the first nonendemic brands to jump into eSports. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/12/red-bull-esports-lab/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull</a>, Pizza Hut, and American Express <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KO\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/coca-cola-63/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KO</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> also have explored professional video gaming.</p>\n<p>Mistry says this millennial audience has grown up in the real-time, high-touch, live-streamed eSports world, where brands are just starting out.</p>\n<p>“Companies need to understand that eSports fans know more than they do about the platforms and channels right now,” Mistry says. “Because of that, these consumers can sniff out a false endorsement or inauthentic sponsorship from a mile away. The best course of action for nonendemic brands in eSports is to respect the sport, be as genuine as possible, and let the fans guide you—they’re the ones who have gotten the industry this far, and you need them on your side.”</p>\n<p>From an investment standpoint, Mistry says leagues, teams, and players make up the bulk of the pie, followed by products. But it’s also important to look at platforms and technology to service the eSports marketplace.</p>\n<p>“In the future, if it’s not happening already, one of the biggest issues that the eSports industry will face is how to level the connected playing field. When you’re playing competitively, one second of lag can make or break a game. Gaming and platform developers, professional leagues, and players will all be looking for the best solution to ensure that they’re operating at the highest level during a competition.”</p>\n<p>Mistry also sees an opportunity with security, since there have been many occasions where a DDoS attack has shut down a team or crushed players when they’re at their peak.</p>\n<p>“Technology is going to have to become normalized in the industry—it’s not sexy, but it’s how eSports will get to the next level,” Mistry says. “While other people are looking at games and gamers, investors should be keeping an eye out for the opportunities in tech that are going to drive the market even further.”</p>\n<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that eSports is still a new business, and one that continues to evolve and grow with multiple leagues and many different games.</p>\n<p>“When you look at the NFL or the NBA, even though we’re talking about different sports, there’s a lot of consistency around the content and rules and quality of the product,” Mistry says. “I’ve seen the eSports industry take strides in that direction, but I’ve also learned that it has a long way to go. And some of that growth will be directly aided by bigger brand players and investors bringing more capital into the market.”</p>\n<p><em>XBox One is faster after its latest update.

              "content": "<p>Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and fellow tech kingpins committed $1 billion to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/11/open-ai/\">researching artificial intelligence</a>. The group&#8217;s findings would be made available for the world. The possibilities where AI might help include the ability to detect anomalies in images of cells to detect cancer, programming robots that can interact with humans, and building programs that could help teach kids at their pace of learning in a more individual style.</p>\n<p>Behind this feel-good effort is a hint at the priorities of some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. It also provides an understanding of how AI or machine learning, as the technology is often called, has the potential to remake the tech world in the same way the web did in the mid-&#8217;90s.</p>\n<p>Worries about artificial intelligence have sparked headlines exclaiming that AI could bring about the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-could-wipe-out-humanity-when-it-gets-too-clever-as-humans-a6686496.html\">death of humanity</a> as smart machines become so much smarter than us they wipe us out, not out of malice, but because we&#8217;re simply in the way of their own goals. The most optimistic ones focused on the possibility of sex robots that can carry on conversations.</p>\n<p>But in reality, AI has existed for over a decade. It already plays a big role in technologies that we take for granted like Apple&#8217;s Siri personal assistant, IBM&#8217;s Watson <em>Jeopardy-</em>winning computer, and even the autopilot feature that Tesla <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TSLA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/tesla-motors-717/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TSLA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> rolled out in its cars earlier this year.</p>\n<p>And before AI can destroy humanity, or provide sexual satisfaction, it has to get better. Much better. And the launch of OpenAI, the billion-dollar nonprofit research center announced this week, opens a window into what some of the big thinkers in computer science and business consider as opportunities and challenges.</p>\n<p>First, as analyst Ben Thompson, who writes over at the site Stratechery, pointed out in an <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/openai-artificial-intelligence-and-data-data-and-recruiting/\">essay about the topic</a>, OpenAI&#8217;s creation can be read as a manifesto, or as a recruiting ad for top research talent.</p>\n<p>Thompson looked past the do-gooder language of the OpenAI blog post, which talks about ensuring that commercial interests don&#8217;t hijack the promise of artificial intelligence research. Instead, he focused on the final line of the third paragraph of the introduction, which reads &#8220;We hope this is what matters most to the best in the field.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The fear is that Google<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, Facebook<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook-242/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and Chinese search engine Baidu <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BIDU\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/bidu/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BIDU</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> are luring all of the machine learning talent to their companies using a sales pitch that hires can work on some of the most complex social problems of our era. Each company uses huge pools of data to help train sophisticated machine learning algorithms.</p>\n<p>Data is the lifeblood of AI. To train computers to learn more like humans, you have to feed them tens of thousands of examples of something. Depending on what type of outcome you are hoping for, the examples can be photos, maps, or words. The computers try to understand what elements of those examples define what makes a cat a cat in an image or what gives meaning to a certain word. The algorithm then gives a statistical weight to each guess that helps the computer &#8220;learn&#8221; what the right answer is. The computer scientist helps train the algorithm by giving feedback and more examples along the way.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why none of these companies ever wants to throw away data. It may come in handy for AI training someday. And that&#8217;s why the promise of using something like Tesla&#8217;s car data for building algorithms might be enough to get a researcher excited to work with OpenAI instead of Google.</p>\n<p>Sam Altman, a co-chair at OpenAI, tells <em>Fortune</em> that data from Tesla would be made available to researchers working at OpenAI. He said he would also work to make data from startups that go through Y Combinator, the accelerator program he leads, available for researchers at OpenAI as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are also plenty of publicly available data sets on the Internet,&#8221; Altman said. Researchers could use those to come up with new tools and algorithms that will advance AI as well.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"11\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4380912836001-11\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4380912836001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P3xWVa\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dai%2Caistrikes%2Caiwar%2Caiwarfare%2Cartificialintelligence%2Cartificialintelligencewar%2Cdronebombing%2Cdronestrike%2Cdronestrikemiddleeast%2Cdronestrikes%2Celonmusk%2Cmilitarydrones%2Cstephenhawking%2Cstevewozniak%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dartificialintelligence&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second element designed to attract talent to OpenAI is its nonprofit status and its pledge of openness. It&#8217;s not that Facebook and others aren&#8217;t open with their research. They publish their research fairly quickly. Google, however, tends to wait until it has gained a significant strategic advantage from a new findings before publishing. But it is still made public.</p>\n<p>Serkan Piantino, director of Facebook&#8217;s AI research program, emphasized the importance of openness in a conference call ahead of premiering his company&#8217;s new servers designed <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/facebook-ai-big-sur/\">especially for training computers to learn</a> earlier this month. Facebook&#8217;s engineers expect the work they do to be contributed back to the open source community. Thus, Facebook contributes code to the community in part because that keeps its civic-minded engineers happy.</p>\n<p>But the race for talent isn&#8217;t the only reason OpenAI exists. The development of true artificial intelligence is going to remake software. And every business wants to be part of that shift.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way software is eating the world today, well, AI will do that to software,&#8221; says Amir Husain, CEO of Spark Cognition, an AI security startup in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>He explained that many kinds of business software that replaced paper documents and in filing cabinets will eventually be transformed into a new format. And that format will likely be more user-friendly because of hard work done by artificial intelligence behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All of these categories will be destroyed and remade, so there&#8217;s a lot of economic potential locked up in this,&#8221; says Husain. &#8220;It&#8217;s sort of like being the only guy in 1995 who knows HTML.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And that, more than anything, is why the big brains in Silicon Valley and at other companies left out of the OpenAI effort are hustling to stake a claim in this space. Rob High, an IBM Fellow, and VP and CTO of IBM&#8217;s Watson Group, explained that the computing giant is interested in learning more about the organization and getting involved.</p>\n<p>IBM, which learned about the OpenAI group on Friday like nearly everyone else, has a decades-long program in artificial intelligence through Watson. The company hopes that it will help it weather the shift from web-based software to new A.I.-related services.</p>\n<p>But IBM <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"IBM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm-24/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">IBM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> is also building an entirely new type of chip designed for artificial intelligence modeled on the human brain, called a synaptic chip. As far as hardware for AI goes, IBM is the most serious player in the space.</p>\n<p>Following is Nvidia<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NVDA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/nvidia-553/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NVDA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, which makes graphics processors that are actually the preferred chip used today for training computers to learn.</p>\n<p>That gets us back to Altman, from OpenAI, and the plans for the nonprofit. The short-term goals, he said are to build tools and algorithms that will be shared publicly. But in the long term, better hardware is needed to build AI that can perform more like a human.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you think about building better AI and modeling it after the human brain, more hardware research and better hardware will be important,&#8221; Altman says. &#8220;But today that is not our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That might be why Altman says OpenAI only spoke very casually with a person who was involved with Watson at IBM, instead of going through formal channels to try to get Big Blue involved with the project. (And why IBM found no record of someone from OpenAI contacting it at all). Or perhaps there&#8217;s simply a divide between the Silicon Valley practice of calling anything with machine learning involved AI and promoting its involvement in new product launches. Meanwhile, IBM, which brands all of its AI efforts under Watson and cognitive computing, may have confused the public.</p>\n<p>Plenty of other companies have their own efforts in artificial intelligence. For example, Apple has hired researchers, but has reportedly found it to be tough to recruit experts. In part, it&#8217;s because the company <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-29/apple-s-secrecy-hurts-its-ai-software-development\">doesn&#8217;t want to share the research results</a>. Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> also has AI research in natural language for its Skype translation efforts and computer recognition that are worth mentioning as well.</p>\n<p>This is a cheaper way to solve the problem and more Amazon-like. Outside of the giant tech firms, startups, industrial giants, researchers and more are all experimenting with using AI. If OpenAI really does build broadly useful tools, that could help advance science for everyone.</p>\n<p>Altman says it&#8217;s too soon to list OpenAI&#8217;s research priorities. It will work on tools and algorithms, but the specific areas where it will focus are unsure. But he said he would consider it a success if the organization, within one year, publishes &#8220;some seminal paper that drives the state of the art forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s clear that technologists supporting the project and those working on AI in general, have much larger goals.</p>\n<p><em>For more on artificial intelligence, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"12\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4587395234001-12\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4587395234001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P3xWVa\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dai%2Cartificialintelligence%2Cblakeirving%2Ccyphyworks%2Cdrones%2Cebay%2Cetsy%2Cgodaddy%2Cgrokker%2Chelengreiner%2Cirobot%2Ckatrinalake%2Ckristinasalen%2Clarsbjork%2Clornaborenstein%2Cnewyorkstockexchange%2Cnyse%2Cqlik%2Cquentinclark%2Crjpittman%2Csap%2Cstitchfix%2Cstitchfix%2Ctechcetera%2Ctomfarley%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechcetera&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><span class=\"\"><i>Make sure to</i><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/philip-elmer-dewitt\"><i> s</i></a><i><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\" target=\"_blank\">ign up for Data Sheet</a>, </i>Fortune’s<i> daily newsletter about the business of technology.</i></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>While many consumers still think of Nintendo platforms as kids&#8217; toys, Mercedes-Benz, a division of Daimler AG<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DDAIF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ddaif/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DDAIF</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, is using Nintendo Wii U to market its $32,500 GLA compact SUV to adult gamers across two very different games.</p>\n<p>The German automaker has created a free <em>Super Mario Maker</em> event course called Mercedes-Benz Jump’n’Drive. The course takes players through a variety of automotive-related areas, including being at the dealership, taking a test drive through a city, and cruising down the autobahn. Once players complete the level, they unlock an in-game Mercedes-Benz GLA with Mario in the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>“Many people grew up with <em>Mario</em> during the last 30 years, so there are quite a lot of 30- and 40-somethings around for which <em>Super Mario Maker</em> hails back to their childhood days and gives them a large dose of nostalgia,” says Caroline Pilz, head of product placement and fashion sponsoring for Mercedes-Benz Cars.</p>\n<p>Pilz says the GLA is part of a new generation of compact-class luxury cars aimed at an affluent and progressive audience, making it a good match with a significant part of <em>Super Mario Maker’s</em> target audience.</p>\n<p>This latest initiative expands a relationship between the game maker and automaker that originated last year with a <em>Mario Kart 8</em> integration. Mercedes sponsored free downloadable content (DLC) for the racing game last summer, which includes the 1957 300 SL Roadster sports car, the 1934 W 25 Silver Arrow formula racing car, and the GLA.</p>\n<p>“While we received a lot of positive feedback on the campaign and the integration of our cars into <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, we also learned that many gamers are skeptical about brands appearing in their games,” Pilz says. “So we made sure to put a lot of effort and passion into designing the actual level.”</p>\n<p>Pilz says the great thing about these video game sponsorships is that there’s no fixed limit. As long as Nintendo <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NTDOY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ntdoy/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NTDOY</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> supports these games, the Mercedes-Benz content stays available as free downloadable or unlockable content.</p>\n<p>With these Nintendo deals, Mercedes now connects with gamers across all three consoles. The car company works with Sony <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SNE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/sne/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SNE</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on its <em>Gran Turismo</em> franchise and Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on its <em>Forza Motorsport</em> games, as well as game publishers like Electronic Arts <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/adams-resources-energy-609/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AE</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on <em>Need for Speed</em> and Bandai Namco <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NCBDF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ncbdf/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NCBDF</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> on <em>Project Cars</em>.</p>\n<p>“Gaming has been important for our branded entertainment marketing strategy since the integration of the SLS AMG sports car in <em>Gran Turismo 5</em> in 2009,” Pilz says. “Since then, we have intensified our relationships with the gaming industry and executed at least one major marketing partnership per year. Moving forward, there is very likely a growing importance of games, as the global gaming audience is growing older and more diverse, and thus becomes even more relevant to us as a brand.”</p>\n<p>Pilz says the presence in racing games is a good way for Mercedes-Benz to make a young, car-enthusiastic audience familiar with its products.</p>\n<p>“We have managed to raise awareness for the sportiness of the brand, thus making the brand more attractive and relevant for new target groups,” Pilz says.</p>\n<p><em>Nintendo&#8217;s first mobile &#8220;game,&#8221; Miitomo, is due out in spring 2016.

              "content": "<p>ESports is big business today, and it’s only just begun.</p>\n<p>The eSports ecosystem, a $278 million industry, could surpass $1 billion as early as 2018, according to research firm Newzoo. The firm estimates there are over 205 million eSports fans globally and that number could grow to over 335 million by 2017.</p>\n<p>With all of these lofty projections, there are investment opportunities in this global video game landscape for those who know where to look. Ashish Mistry, managing partner at private investment firm BLH Venture Partners, knows eSports. His company, KontrolFreek, makes accessories for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers that pro gamers use to get a competitive edge in games like <em>Halo 5: Guardians</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em>.</p>\n<p>Mistry points to opportunities beyond the traditional media buys for live-streamed eSports events across Twitch, YouTube, and the upcoming Turner ELeague with <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. It’s becoming increasingly popular to see a product be the official controller or headset of a live event, which he says is a great way to advertise.</p>\n<p>“One of the most unique opportunities in the live-streaming eSports space is that brands can sponsor players,” Mistry says. “With the way that eSports operates currently, sometimes it makes sense to sponsor a player instead of their team. We see professionals switch teams all the time, and in some cases their name can carry more weight than the team name. Of course, there is also room in the space for brands to sponsor teams, or even a whole gaming league, as well.”</p>\n<p>While eSports has its roots in PC gaming, big companies like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/05/microsoft-halo-5-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/09/activision-call-of-duty-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Activision Publishing</a><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ATVI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/activision-blizzard-585/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ATVI</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/capcom-street-fighter-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Capcom</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CCOEF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ccoef/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CCOEF</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> have been investing in growing the console market with games like <em>Halo 5, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em>, and <em>Street Fighter IV. </em>Separately, companies like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/23/vainglory-mobile-esports/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Evil Megacorp</a> and Blizzard Entertainment have introduced eSports to mobile gamers through <em>Vainglory</em> and <em>Hearthstone.</em></p>\n<p>Mistry says these investments in the eSports market are starting to open up to broader audiences. This will make room for more players, teams, and brands.</p>\n<p>“The first NASCAR sponsors were car-related brands such as Goodyear, Valvoline, and others,” Mistry says. “Once those blocks were in place and money started coming in, brands like Coke and Sharpie were able to justify investing in the sport to sponsor teams and cars. I see the same thing happen with eSports.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/30/coke-expands-esports-reach/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KO\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/coca-cola-63/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KO</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> was one of the first nonendemic brands to jump into eSports. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/12/red-bull-esports-lab/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull</a>, Pizza Hut, and American Express <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KO\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/coca-cola-63/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KO</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> also have explored professional video gaming.</p>\n<p>Mistry says this millennial audience has grown up in the real-time, high-touch, live-streamed eSports world, where brands are just starting out.</p>\n<p>“Companies need to understand that eSports fans know more than they do about the platforms and channels right now,” Mistry says. “Because of that, these consumers can sniff out a false endorsement or inauthentic sponsorship from a mile away. The best course of action for nonendemic brands in eSports is to respect the sport, be as genuine as possible, and let the fans guide you—they’re the ones who have gotten the industry this far, and you need them on your side.”</p>\n<p>From an investment standpoint, Mistry says leagues, teams, and players make up the bulk of the pie, followed by products. But it’s also important to look at platforms and technology to service the eSports marketplace.</p>\n<p>“In the future, if it’s not happening already, one of the biggest issues that the eSports industry will face is how to level the connected playing field. When you’re playing competitively, one second of lag can make or break a game. Gaming and platform developers, professional leagues, and players will all be looking for the best solution to ensure that they’re operating at the highest level during a competition.”</p>\n<p>Mistry also sees an opportunity with security, since there have been many occasions where a DDoS attack has shut down a team or crushed players when they’re at their peak.</p>\n<p>“Technology is going to have to become normalized in the industry—it’s not sexy, but it’s how eSports will get to the next level,” Mistry says. “While other people are looking at games and gamers, investors should be keeping an eye out for the opportunities in tech that are going to drive the market even further.”</p>\n<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that eSports is still a new business, and one that continues to evolve and grow with multiple leagues and many different games.</p>\n<p>“When you look at the NFL or the NBA, even though we’re talking about different sports, there’s a lot of consistency around the content and rules and quality of the product,” Mistry says. “I’ve seen the eSports industry take strides in that direction, but I’ve also learned that it has a long way to go. And some of that growth will be directly aided by bigger brand players and investors bringing more capital into the market.”</p>\n<p><em>XBox One is faster after its latest update.

      "content": "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">The MPW Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in business contribute answers to timely questions about careers and leadership. Today’s answer to the question: What should every 20-something do to set themselves up for success? is written by </span></em></span><span class=\"s1\"><em>Teresa Hassara,</em></span><span class=\"s1\"><em> president of Institutional Retirement at TIAA-CREF.</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the most rewarding parts of my role leading large organizations is mentoring young professionals in the early stages of their careers. As I reflect on the many conversations </span><span class=\"s2\">I&#8217;ve</span><span class=\"s1\"> had over the years, three pieces of advice</span><span class=\"s2\"> come to mind</span><span class=\"s1\"> that remain timeless. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In terms of your professional career, get your story straight. And I mean <i>your </i>story. You never know when someone is going to ask you who you are and what you do. Young professionals, especially women, often have trouble promoting themselves to others. They focus on their title and who they work for rather than explaining the contributions they make or the strengths they bring to their team.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Take the time to come up with a short description of the role you play in the success of your team. Connect what you do with the business priorities of the company or organization that you work for. Focus not on tasks,but on impact and be sure to include some recent examples to provide the proof points for your story. Then, practice delivering your story so it becomes second nature. </span><span class=\"s1\">With your story written, the next time you are riding in the elevator with the company President, or being introduced in a meeting, you’ll be sure to make a positive and memorable impression. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/16/never-focus-first-job/\" target=\"_blank\">Never Focus On This at Your First Job</a></em></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But don’t let that story sit on the shelf forever. Update it regularly to reflect your growth and new achievements. Keep a journal of key accomplishments to include in your story and reiterate when it comes time for your performance review. Your career success will definitely benefit from reminding your manager of the role your contributions play in achieving key business goals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This is another area where I see young women downplay their contributions. They think touting what they have achieved is bragging and tend to focus more on areas where they want to grow rather than how strong they already are. Or they generalize what they did to focus on the results of the team and use words like “supported” or “helped.” Being a team player is important, but don’t let it completely overshadow you as an individual. This is your chance to talk about what sets you apart from others, so make the most of the opportunity when it is presented to you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, as president of the retirement business for TIAA-CREF, it’s probably not surprising that my advice includes something on this topic. When it comes to success in life, I truly believe the most important thing is to take control of your financial well-being. Get help if financial planning isn’t your passion or expertise. If you are fortunate enough to have access to a retirement plan at work, start there. The earlier you get started and the better you understand how to provide for yourself and those you love, the freer you will be to pursue your passions. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><em><span class=\"s1\"><em>Read all answers to the MPW Insider question: <em><span class=\"s1\">What should every 20-something do to set themselves up for success?</span></em></em></span></em></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/15/skill-overlooked-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\">This Important Skill Is Often Overlooked In Leaders</a> </em><span class=\"s1\">by Sally Blount, dean of Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/secret-finding-success-20s/\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret to Finding Success In Your 20s</a> </em>by Ritu Anand, head of talent management at Tata Consultancy Services.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/01/common-myth-young-professional-avoid/\" target=\"_blank\">The Common Myth Young Professionals Need to Avoid</a> </em>by Yolanda Seals-Coffield, principal at PwC.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/29/millennials-succeed-first-job/\" target=\"_blank\">How Millennials Can Succeed at Their First Job</a> </em>by Lynn Perkins, CEO of UrbanSitter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/18/overcome-challenges-career-change/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Overcome Challenges of a Career Change</a> </em>by Lisa Lambert, vice president of Intel Capital.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/14/20-something-first-job/\" target=\"_blank\">What every 20-something should know about their first job</a> </em>by Cathy Engelbert, CEO of Deloitte.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"12\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4616797165001-12\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4616797165001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1ma5R50\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/mpw_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcsuite%2Ccorporateboardrooms%2Cmostpowerfulwomen%2Cmpw%2Cwomen%2Cwomenexecutives%26ch%3Dmpw%26topic%3Dmostpowerfulwomen&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

          "content": "<div class=\"qtext_para\">\n<p>By Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook</p>\n<p><strong>Find work you love. </strong>When you believe in what you are doing, you can combine passion with contribution – and that is a true gift. Keep trying and you will find what you love to do… and once you do, you will crush it.</p>\n<p><strong>Believe you can do anything. </strong>This is important for everyone and especially for women. Don’t let anyone tell you can’t have both a meaningful professional career and a fulfilling personal life. When you hear someone say you can&#8217;t do something, know that you can and start figuring out how. Ask yourself, “What would I do if I weren’t afraid?”</p>\n<p><strong>There is no straight path to where you are going.</strong> If you try to draw that line you will not just get it wrong, but you will miss big opportunities. As Pattie Sellers of <em>Fortune Magazine</em> says, careers are not ladders but jungle gyms. You don&#8217;t have to have it all figured out. I recommend adopting two concurrent goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A long-term dream: It doesn&#8217;t have to be realistic or even specific. For example, you might say you want to work in a specific field, travel the world, have more free time. Even a vague goal can provide direction.</li>\n<li>An 18-month plan: Set personal goals for what you want to learn in the next year and a half. Ask yourself how you can improve and what you&#8217;re afraid to do (that&#8217;s usually the thing you should try).</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"13\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4594775900001-13\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4594775900001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Qt3ur0\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dadreessenandhorowitz%2Calanmurrary%2Cfacebook%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cinequality%2Cmarcandreessen%2Csherylsandberg%2Ctechbubble%2Cunicorns%2Cvaluation%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Sheryl-Sandberg/session/2015-12-15/\">Quora</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n",

Today’s answer to the question “What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</span><span class=\"s1\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">is by Alicia Navarro, CEO of Skimlinks. </span></em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the early days of starting Skimlinks</span><span class=\"s2\"> I didn&#8217;t have customers, investors</span><span class=\"s1\">,</span><span class=\"s2\"> or employees. Instead, I had a huge amount of work to do and no one else to do it but me. It was tempting to focus completely on my workload and ignore the rest of the world, but I forced myself out (with moderation) </span><span class=\"s1\">to</span><span class=\"s2\"> attend events, meetups, award shows, conferences, and more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The fact is that “getting out there,” is an essential part of being an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs do not operate in a void, and a company’s success depends on more than just a functional product. The connections you have with the outside world are critical: potential and current customers, fellow entrepreneurs, investors, advisors</span><span class=\"s1\">, etc</span><span class=\"s2\">. Not just because of the business opportunities that can be forged through these encounters, but also a broad diversity of perspectives can </span><span class=\"s3\">only</span><span class=\"s2\"> strengthen you and your company. You can’t do it alone, and the most important lesson I’ve learned in my career is the value of networking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Nevertheless, sometimes</span><span class=\"s3\">, </span><span class=\"s2\">I thought the events were a waste of time. I felt guilty spending time socializing and having a glass of wine rather than tackling the items on my to-do list. Other times, I enjoyed the experiences as they offered a release from the pressure and loneliness of starting a company. And finally, on some occasions, I found myself meeting people and being exposed to ideas that were immediately helpful to my business. The thing is, there </span><span class=\"s1\">is</span><span class=\"s2\"> no way of knowing ahead of time which of </span><span class=\"s1\">these</span><span class=\"s2\"> three categories an event </span><span class=\"s1\">would fall in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/starting-new-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Never Do This When You&#8217;re Starting a New Business</a></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">My expectations were often inverted. A happy hour I thought would be futile, turned out to be unexpectedly fun and insightful; or a conference that I spent a lot of money on </span><span class=\"s1\">&#8212; </span><span class=\"s2\">anticipating it would be valuable </span><span class=\"s1\">&#8212;</span><span class=\"s2\"> turned out to be a dud. It is impossible (and distracting) to attend </span><span class=\"s1\">every event</span><span class=\"s2\"> and shortsighted to attend none. As an entrepreneur, you have to navigate this uncertainty and figure out how to integrate socializing into your work life. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">I found that the only way to navigate this chaos was to have no expectations, and allow myself to be pleasantly surprised if the event turned out great, but also appreciative of a simple night out (even if the event was underwhelming.) I tried to approach each event with an open mind, and </span><span class=\"s3\">to</span><span class=\"s2\"> balance my commitments so I wasn&#8217;t going to every event </span><span class=\"s1\">purely due to </span><span class=\"s2\">fear of missing out.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Pushing myself to regularly go out and network also taught me the power of never saying &#8220;never.&#8221; I found that opportunities that may not seem beneficial in the moment often prove so down the road. For example, that random person you met while getting a drink at an event turns out to be friends with a VC and helps you get a meeting.

Keep trying and you will find what you love to do… and once you do, you will crush it.</p>\n<p><strong>Believe you can do anything. </strong>This is important for everyone and especially for women. Don’t let anyone tell you can’t have both a meaningful professional career and a fulfilling personal life. When you hear someone say you can&#8217;t do something, know that you can and start figuring out how. Ask yourself, “What would I do if I weren’t afraid?”</p>\n<p><strong>There is no straight path to where you are going.</strong> If you try to draw that line you will not just get it wrong, but you will miss big opportunities. As Pattie Sellers of <em>Fortune Magazine</em> says, careers are not ladders but jungle gyms. You don&#8217;t have to have it all figured out. I recommend adopting two concurrent goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A long-term dream: It doesn&#8217;t have to be realistic or even specific. For example, you might say you want to work in a specific field, travel the world, have more free time. Even a vague goal can provide direction.</li>\n<li>An 18-month plan: Set personal goals for what you want to learn in the next year and a half. Ask yourself how you can improve and what you&#8217;re afraid to do (that&#8217;s usually the thing you should try).</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"4\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4594775900001-4\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4594775900001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Qt3ur0\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dadreessenandhorowitz%2Calanmurrary%2Cfacebook%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cinequality%2Cmarcandreessen%2Csherylsandberg%2Ctechbubble%2Cunicorns%2Cvaluation%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Sheryl-Sandberg/session/2015-12-15/\">Quora</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n",

Today’s answer to the question “What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</span><span class=\"s1\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">is by Alicia Navarro, CEO of Skimlinks. </span></em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the early days of starting Skimlinks</span><span class=\"s2\"> I didn&#8217;t have customers, investors</span><span class=\"s1\">,</span><span class=\"s2\"> or employees. Instead, I had a huge amount of work to do and no one else to do it but me. It was tempting to focus completely on my workload and ignore the rest of the world, but I forced myself out (with moderation) </span><span class=\"s1\">to</span><span class=\"s2\"> attend events, meetups, award shows, conferences, and more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The fact is that “getting out there,” is an essential part of being an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs do not operate in a void, and a company’s success depends on more than just a functional product. The connections you have with the outside world are critical: potential and current customers, fellow entrepreneurs, investors, advisors</span><span class=\"s1\">, etc</span><span class=\"s2\">. Not just because of the business opportunities that can be forged through these encounters, but also a broad diversity of perspectives can </span><span class=\"s3\">only</span><span class=\"s2\"> strengthen you and your company. You can’t do it alone, and the most important lesson I’ve learned in my career is the value of networking.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Nevertheless, sometimes</span><span class=\"s3\">, </span><span class=\"s2\">I thought the events were a waste of time. I felt guilty spending time socializing and having a glass of wine rather than tackling the items on my to-do list. Other times, I enjoyed the experiences as they offered a release from the pressure and loneliness of starting a company. And finally, on some occasions, I found myself meeting people and being exposed to ideas that were immediately helpful to my business. The thing is, there </span><span class=\"s1\">is</span><span class=\"s2\"> no way of knowing ahead of time which of </span><span class=\"s1\">these</span><span class=\"s2\"> three categories an event </span><span class=\"s1\">would fall in.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/10/starting-new-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Never Do This When You&#8217;re Starting a New Business</a></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">My expectations were often inverted. A happy hour I thought would be futile, turned out to be unexpectedly fun and insightful; or a conference that I spent a lot of money on </span><span class=\"s1\">&#8212; </span><span class=\"s2\">anticipating it would be valuable </span><span class=\"s1\">&#8212;</span><span class=\"s2\"> turned out to be a dud. It is impossible (and distracting) to attend </span><span class=\"s1\">every event</span><span class=\"s2\"> and shortsighted to attend none. As an entrepreneur, you have to navigate this uncertainty and figure out how to integrate socializing into your work life. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">I found that the only way to navigate this chaos was to have no expectations, and allow myself to be pleasantly surprised if the event turned out great, but also appreciative of a simple night out (even if the event was underwhelming.) I tried to approach each event with an open mind, and </span><span class=\"s3\">to</span><span class=\"s2\"> balance my commitments so I wasn&#8217;t going to every event </span><span class=\"s1\">purely due to </span><span class=\"s2\">fear of missing out.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Pushing myself to regularly go out and network also taught me the power of never saying &#8220;never.&#8221; I found that opportunities that may not seem beneficial in the moment often prove so down the road. For example, that random person you met while getting a drink at an event turns out to be friends with a VC and helps you get a meeting. Or the junior person who approaches you after a startup pitch event ends up getting a higher-level job </span><span class=\"s1\">with</span><span class=\"s2\"> a key customer </span><span class=\"s1\">of yours</span><span class=\"s2\">, and helps you win a deal you wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise won. You never know who will end up being valuable or helpful, so invest in all relationships.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"5\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4422538924001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4422538924001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1meOFvm\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/mpw_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbeauty%2Ccosmetics%2Cfutureofwork%2Cipsy%2Cipsycom%2Clifestyle%2Cmakeup%2Cmichellephan%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dmpw%26topic%3Dfutureofwork&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Read all responses to the Leadership Insider question: What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/sign-working-in-toxic-office/\" target=\"_blank\">A Major Sign You’re Working In a Toxic Office</a></em> by Sandhya Venkatachalam, co-founder and partner of Centerview Capital.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/15/best-way-deliver-bad-news-to-employees/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Way to Deliver Bad News to Employees</a> </em>by Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/15/best-way-deliver-bad-news-to-employees/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Way to Deliver Bad News to Employees</a> </em>by Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/14/never-hire-job-candidate-first/\" target=\"_blank\">You Should Never Hire A Job Candidate Without Doing This First</a> </em>by Phil Friedman CEO of CGS.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/12/one-quality-leader-never-lacks/\" target=\"_blank\">The One Quality A Leader Should Never Lack</a> </em>by David Silverman, CEO of McChrystal Group.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/11/ceo-learned-40-million-dollar-mistake/\" target=\"_blank\">What This CEO Learned From a $40 Million Mistake</a> </em>by Brad Smith, CEO of Intuit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/10/most-valuable-lesson-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\">The Most Valuable Lesson You Learn As An Entrepreneur</a></em> by Shahrzad Rafati, founder and CEO of BroadbandTV.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/05/nice-at-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Why It Pays To Be Nice at Work</a> </em>by Erin “Mack” McKelvey, CEO of SalientMG.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/02/successful-career-change-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">The key to a successful career change: start a blog</a></em> by Peter Thomson, marketing director of SeedInvest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/secret-difficult-coworkers/\" target=\"_blank\">The secret to dealing with difficult coworkers</a></em> by Clark Valberg, CEO of InVision.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/29/plan-for-successful-career/\" target=\"_blank\">The best way to plan for a successful career?

      "title": "How Theranos Misled Me",
      "content": "<p>In a June 2014 <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\">cover story</a> for Fortune, I helped raise to prominence the inventor-entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes and her remarkable—I think everyone will still go along with that adjective—diagnostics company Theranos.</p>\n<p>Fairly high up in my story there is a whopping false statement. After explaining that Theranos’s tests could be performed with a finger-stick, rather than using traditional venipuncture (a syringe in the crook of the arm), I wrote that the company “currently offers 200—and is ramping up to offer more than 1000—of the most commonly ordered blood diagnostic tests, all without the need of a syringe.”</p>\n<p>Sixteen months later, John Carreyrou of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published a now famous <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">front-page story</a> containing a wide range of unflattering accusations about Theranos. Among them, he reported that one “former senior employee” had told him—in an account generally corroborated by three other former employees—that as of December 2014, the company was actually performing only about 15 finger-stick tests using its proprietary technology; the remainder were being performed using conventional, third-party analyzer machines, made by companies like Siemens—i.e., the same machines used by conventional labs like Quest Diagnostics <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DGX\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/quest-diagnostics-375/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DGX</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and LabCorp <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"LH\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/laboratory-corp-of-america-440/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">LH</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>.</p>\n<p>In that <em>Journal</em> article, a Theranos spokesperson was quoted flatly denying the newspaper’s allegations in a blanket manner, but refusing to be specific, citing trade secrets. Notably, from my perspective, she did not say how many tests the company had, in fact, been performing by proprietary methods in December 2014.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theranos.com/news/posts/statement-from-theranos\">longer statement</a> issued the same day on its website, Theranos further blasted the <em>Journal</em> for, among other things, relying on the accounts of “anonymous, disgruntled former employees,” but still declined to state how many proprietary tests it had really been performing.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until a week later—on Oct. 22—that Theranos, after stonewalling and threats of legal action failed to quell the furor, offered a serious, 14-page <a href=\"https://www.theranos.com/news/posts/custom/theranos-facts\">response</a> to the <em>Journal</em> article, addressing the full panoply of its accusations. Among other things the company asserted that, as of December 2014, it had in fact been performing “more than 80 of the tests on our online test menu via finger-stick,” and that all but “a few” of those “ran using proprietary technologies.” It also asserted that in the fourth quarter of 2014, 57% of all tests ordered had been performed by finger-stick.</p>\n<p>Those figures, if accurate, would suggest that the company might well be accomplishing, as it has claimed, something genuinely innovative and beneficial to society. I should add that the company’s extremely low prices and price-transparency would also be of unquestionable benefit to society, even if the company weren’t doing <em>anything</em> technologically innovative. On the other hand, all these advances matter only if Theranos’s tests are also reliable, which the <em>Journal</em> article also cast doubt upon. In my opinion, the evidence for this was weaker than its evidence that the company was misrepresenting its accomplishments.</p>\n<p>After Theranos’s Oct. 22 statement, I contacted officials there to inquire how many tests it had actually been commercially performing by proprietary means in June 2014, when I had reported that it was offering more than 200. A spokesperson acknowledged to me that it was fewer than 200, but declined to specify how many. She said she’d send a statement.</p>\n<p>(<em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> In the meantime, Holmes gave the following interview with <em>Fortune</em> Editor Alan Murray at the Fortune Global Forum:)</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"15\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4593102738001-15\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4593102738001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1IWhvuM\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalanmurray%2Cbloodtests%2Celizabethholmes%2Celizabethholmesvideo%2Cfda%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cfortuneglobalforumvideo%2Cglobalforum%2Ctheranos%2Ctheranosbloodtests%2Ctheranosvideo%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>The company&#8217;s statement arrived Nov. 3. “As discussed when you visited Theranos,” it said, “Theranos could perform hundreds of tests (more than 200) using its proprietary technologies. The reports you reviewed at Theranos covered many of those tests Theranos developed for use with finger-stick samples.”</p>\n<p>(The company had, indeed, provided me in the Spring of 2014 with what it said were—and what looked to be—validation studies for scores of different diagnostic tests, though, in truth, I lacked the expertise to assess their significance.)</p>\n<p>The statement then went on to address my followup question, which was basically: <em>If you were capable of doing 200-plus tests using your proprietary methods, why weren’t you in fact doing them?</em></p>\n<p>Here, with trademark, Theranos-ian opacity, is the reply:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over time, we&#8217;ve been optimizing our clinical lab to bring up tests that are more commonly ordered, and in some cases move resources off the proprietary tests that are less commonly ordered to get to a point where the ordering patterns we are seeing can all be accommodated through our finger-stick technology.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Got that? </em></p>\n<p>I then started looking back at my research for the original story—which had been conducted, by then, 17-19 months earlier—to try to reconstruct how I made the error.</p>\n<p>As much as I’d like to say that Holmes lied to me, I don’t think she did. I do believe I was misled—intentionally—but I was also culpable, in that I failed to probe certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received.</p>\n<p>“We do routine, specialty, and esoteric tests,” Holmes told me in May 2014. “What we’ve done is take those, and develop the chemistry and analytic systems that made it possible to run them on a microsystem.”</p>\n<p>When I started my research in March 2014, there were maybe something like 100 tests listed on Theranos’s online test menu. The number was gradually climbing as my work continued. By the time I was ready to publish there were 214 tests listed. I assumed that meant they had now adapted 214 tests to run on their microsystem.</p>\n<p>In fact, at the time I didn’t know what else it could have meant. That’s because, so far as I can tell, at the time of my research the company had never revealed that it ever used conventional, nonproprietary analyzers to perform the tests it listed on its menu other than for research purposes.</p>\n<p>About a year later—in May <em>2015</em>—Holmes did explain to me, as I reported <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/07/theranos-jump-starts-consumer-lab-testing/\">then</a>, that the company had begun using such third-party analyzers, analyzing blood drawn by venipuncture. It had begun doing so, she explained, in order to be able to perform less commonly ordered tests, which she referred to as “esoteric” tests, thereby providing customers with one-stop shopping. This was presented to me as a new development, however—a departure from prior practice.</p>\n<p>In mid-September 2015—after an inspection at which an FDA official opined that the company’s tiny blood collection device, known as a nanotainer, was an “uncleared” medical device—Theranos discontinued using its proprietary methods for all but at most one test, for which it had already received full FDA approval. This fact didn’t come to light until a month later, about a day after Carreyrou’s first article, and just a few hours before his second.</p>\n<p>Back in early 2014, on both its website and in press releases of that time, Theranos did disclose that “we can use a tiny finger-stick or collect a <em>micro-sample</em> from a venous draw” (emphasis added). It thereby acknowledging that it was capable of doing venipuncture, but stressed that even then it strived to take only <em>micro-samples</em>. In our conversations, Holmes defined the word &#8220;micro-sample&#8221; as referring to the &#8220;tiny samples&#8221; or &#8220;these tiny droplets we take.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thus, “micro-samples”—whether from finger-stick or venipuncture—were what the company was about, and my assumption was that in either case they were being analyzed by the same proprietary devices, which were designed specifically to read tiny samples.</p>\n<p>The company’s, ads, promotional materials, and posters hanging on the headquarter walls, all seemed to hammer home this point. They featured slogans like “One tiny drop changes everything”; “All the same tests. One tiny sample”; and “1/1000<sup>th</sup> the size of a typical blood draw; Theranos runs any test available in central laboratories.”</p>\n<p>My interviews with Holmes in 2014 seemed to further reenforce the point. “When we do collect venipuncture,” Holmes explained to me back then, “we take a smaller sample than traditionally required and we also use the smallest needle. It’s a tiny butterfly needle. The least painful. So it is a smaller volume.”</p>\n<p>Surely this meant they were still analyzing these tiny draws with their proprietary devices—the ones uniquely designed to do so, I thought.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the truth is that there was at least one great, flapping red flag that I missed. By May of 2014, I had already heard about anecdotes in which people had shown up at one of Theranos’s Wellness Centers and had been disappointed to learn that the test they ordered would require a venipuncture draw.</p>\n<p>So I asked why that sometimes happened.</p>\n<p>“The biggest reason,” Holmes told me in May 2014, “is we’re scaling. As we’re building out this infrastructure, we’re also building out our inventory and our capacity in terms of the number of samples that we can handle at any given point in time. . . . We’ll use venipuncture in addition to the micro-samples just to handle the volume of sample that we’re processing.”</p>\n<p>I couldn’t understand why venipuncture would help cope with volume. <em>Were they running out of nanotainers or some other specialized piece of equipment needed for fingerstick draws at some of the Wellness Centers? Running short of some reagent? Or was it just that they hadn’t yet adapted certain tests for their proprietary platform?</em></p>\n<p>“It’s more how we configure our own analytical systems,” she said, “and the capacity that we have in those systems at any given point in time. And it evolves and it’s changing. Every week we have more and more capacity.”</p>\n<p>I remember coming back to this point again later: <em>How exactly would venipuncture help them cope with volume?</em></p>\n<p>I was told that my question was getting into the realm of trade secret.</p>\n<p>A secret, for sure. But maybe a different kind of secret.</p>\n<p>So I blew it. And I should have included all these colloquies in the original story. I regret the error.</p>\n",

Someone came up to me the other day, and they were like, ‘I have never read an article about Mark Zuckerberg that starts with ‘A young man.’ ”</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Holmes doesn&#8217;t go so far as to label it sexism, her message is clear: The story would have played out differently if she were a man.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"16\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4593102738001-16\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4593102738001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1HWCtJL\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalanmurray%2Cbloodtests%2Celizabethholmes%2Celizabethholmesvideo%2Cfda%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cfortuneglobalforumvideo%2Cglobalforum%2Ctheranos%2Ctheranosbloodtests%2Ctheranosvideo%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>For months, there&#8217;s been speculation about whether Holmes&#8217; gender played a role in the deluge of skeptical stories that followed t<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">he<em> Wall Street Journal</em>&#8216;</a>s original Theranos exposé. Publications including<em><a href=\"http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/news/a31268/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-scandal-besides-the-point/\"> Elle</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/117841-is-criticism-of-billionaire-elizabeth-holmes-sexist-yes-no\">Bustle</a> </em>ran pieces that accused the media of using sexist and condescending language in stories about Holmes and the controversy.<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/theranos-founder-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-feminist-icon/\"><em> Fortune</em> </a>also jumped into the fray, as I argued that tough media scrutiny is actually a sign that we&#8217;re treating Holmes like any other founder.</p>\n<p>Holmes also alludes to the effect that her age and gender &#8212; she was famously 19 when she started Theranos&#8211;may have had on investors and media earlier in her career:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I wanted the focus to be on my work,” she says slowly and deliberately. “I don’t want to go into a meeting and have people looking at what I’m wearing. I want them listening to what I’m saying. And I want them to be looking at what we do.” She pauses, then adds, “Because when you walk into the room and you’re a 19-year-old girl, people interact with you in a certain way.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Prior to the <em>Journal</em> article, Holmes was something of a media darling, appearing on the covers of several national magazines (including <em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\">Fortune</a></em>). Given the paucity of young, female tech founders, there&#8217;s no doubt that her status as woman played some role in that coverage.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Holmes has spoken out on issues related to women in technology. In a <em><a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/inspired/women-of-the-year/2015/elizabeth-holmes\">Glamour</a></em> interview, she credited her parents for encouraging her to play with Legos as well a Barbies, and earlier this year spoke to <em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/elizabeth-holmes-calls-on-women/\">Fortune</a> </em>about her #IronSisters campaign, which she said she created to encourage women to help one another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

          "content": "<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is ready to take on a new task: closely regulating laboratory developed tests. The reason: such tests &#8220;may have caused or have caused&#8221; actual harm to patients by misdiagnosing potentially serious conditions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;FDA oversight would help ensure that tests are supported by rigorous evidence,&#8221; Peter Lurie, the FDA&#8217;s associate commissioner for public health strategy and analysis, wrote in a blog post. &#8220;That patients and health care providers can have confidence in the test results, and that LDTs have more scientifically accurate product labeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, are used to diagnose various diseases and are designed, manufactured, and used in a single laboratory. They&#8217;ve been around for some time and differ from standard diagnostic tools that require strict regulatory oversight and are widely distributed to doctors&#8217; offices, hospitals, and other laboratories.</p>\n<p>Theranos, a blood-testing company that develops LDTs, captured headlines in recent weeks after <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\" target=\"_blank\">a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> alleged that the company cheated on proficiency tests and suggested that its proprietary LDTs lacked high-levels of consistency and accuracy. CEO Elizabeth Holmes, the subject of <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\" target=\"_blank\">a <em>Fortune</em> cover story</a>, rebutted those allegations and said <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/21/theranos-wsj-defense/\" target=\"_blank\">there was no deception</a>. Holmes has supported FDA regulation of LDTs and said Theranos would voluntarily submit its tests for FDA review, whereas most of the industry has aggressively campaigned against such a move. Theranos already has one FDA approval for its herpes simplex-virus type 1.</p>\n<p>Up until now, the FDA has <a href=\"http://blogs.fda.gov/FDAvoice/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;exercised enforcement discretion&#8221; towards LDTs</a>, meaning that they haven&#8217;t held these tests to the highest level of scrutiny under existing laws. LDTs rarely undergo FDA review to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and confirm that they provide clinically meaningful results.</p>\n<p>The primary reason LDTs flew under the radar until now is that they previously focused on relatively simple tests, usually for rare conditions. However, LDTs have ventured into more and more complex conditions in recent years and are now used to diagnose common and serious medical conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. The effect on patients is much broader, and any misdiagnosis could result in real harm to patients&#8211;and significant public health costs.</p>\n<p>A test could provide a false positive, resulting in unnecessary treatments and mounting costs. But, even more dangerous is a false negative, thus leaving a patient in harm&#8217;s way.</p>\n<p>For instance, one LDT used to detect a HER2 gene mutation, which is connected to an aggressive form of breast cancer that requires special HER2-targeting drugs, failed to detect the mutation about 20% of the time. That means that these patients didn&#8217;t receive the best-in-class treatment, compromising their ability to battle breast cancer. The social cost per each <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/UCM472777.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">false-negative case totaled $775,278</a>, according to analysis by FDA economists.</p>\n<p>The FDA is now stepping in and proposing to step up its oversight of these tests. The agency issued a draft guidance last year and is now working to put the finishing touches on the proposal to phase in implementation of premarket review for LDTs.</p>\n",

According to the <em>Journal </em>story, Safeway <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SWY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/safeway-84/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SWY</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> had spent some $350 million to build clinics that offered Theranos blood tests in more than 800 stores, but Theranos missed deadlines for the planned rollout and the tests never began.</p>\n<p>The partnership was never announced by either company but had the internal code name of &#8220;T-rex&#8221; and dates back to 2011, the<em> Journal </em>says. Theranos disputes the story. The company&#8217;s general counsel Heather King told the <em>Journal</em>, “We don’t comment on discussions with other companies,&#8221; but that its report on the Safeway deal is &#8220;inaccurate and defamatory.&#8221; The company <a href=\"https://www.theranos.com/news/posts/statement-from-theranos-5\" target=\"_blank\">posted the same response</a> to its web site, writing that it was &#8220;disappointed to see yet another inaccurate WSJ article,&#8221; without actually identifying the story or linking to it.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Theranos directed <em>Fortune </em>to the statement on its web site; a spokesperson for Safeway declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The report comes amid an ongoing scandal over whether Theranos and its founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes misrepresented the company&#8217;s technology.</p>\n<p>The media storm began with a <em>Journal </em><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">story</a> last month that reported Theranos does not use its own technology in the majority of its testing. The company fired back and criticized the story, but since then, Theranos has had to enter a &#8220;pause period&#8221; as partners like Walgreen <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"WAG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/wag/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">WAG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> await further information. The drugstore chain has <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/24/walgreens-theranos/\">halted the expansion</a> of its own Theranos centers; a former Apple executive <a href=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/10/18/theranos-trouble-a-first-person-account/\">wrote</a> that he had faulty results with a Theranos test; another Silicon Valley executive <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/21/another-tale-of-theranos-patient-woe/\">told </a><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/21/another-tale-of-theranos-patient-woe/\">Fortune</a> </em>a similar story; and the FDA announced that it <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hot-startup-theranos-dials-back-lab-tests-at-fdas-behest-1444961864\">has not approved</a> one of the medical devices Theranos utilizes.</p>\n<p>The biotech startup still carries a $9 billion valuation. Last week <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/02/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fda/\">Holmes appeared at <em>Fortune’s</em> Global Forum</a> and defended her company. She said Theranos is using just one “finger prick” blood test commercially, but that this was her own cautious decision based on FDA approvals. &#8220;That doesn’t mean we don’t have the technology to do them,” she said. “There’s no reason we can’t do peer review and publish other statistics.”</p>\n<p>For more, see our <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/31/theranos-timeline/\">full timeline of the entire Theranos saga</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"17\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4592960749001-17\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4592960749001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1GWL5Q4\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalanmurray%2Cbloodtests%2Celizabethholmes%2Celizabethholmesvideo%2Cfda%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cfortuneglobalforumvideo%2Cglobalforum%2Ctheranos%2Ctheranosbloodtests%2Ctheranosvideo%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

Someone came up to me the other day, and they were like, ‘I have never read an article about Mark Zuckerberg that starts with ‘A young man.’ ”</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Holmes doesn&#8217;t go so far as to label it sexism, her message is clear: The story would have played out differently if she were a man.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"7\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4593102738001-7\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4593102738001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1HWCtJL\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalanmurray%2Cbloodtests%2Celizabethholmes%2Celizabethholmesvideo%2Cfda%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cfortuneglobalforumvideo%2Cglobalforum%2Ctheranos%2Ctheranosbloodtests%2Ctheranosvideo%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>For months, there&#8217;s been speculation about whether Holmes&#8217; gender played a role in the deluge of skeptical stories that followed t<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">he<em> Wall Street Journal</em>&#8216;</a>s original Theranos exposé. Publications including<em><a href=\"http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/news/a31268/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-scandal-besides-the-point/\"> Elle</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/117841-is-criticism-of-billionaire-elizabeth-holmes-sexist-yes-no\">Bustle</a> </em>ran pieces that accused the media of using sexist and condescending language in stories about Holmes and the controversy.<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/theranos-founder-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-feminist-icon/\"><em> Fortune</em> </a>also jumped into the fray, as I argued that tough media scrutiny is actually a sign that we&#8217;re treating Holmes like any other founder.</p>\n<p>Holmes also alludes to the effect that her age and gender &#8212; she was famously 19 when she started Theranos&#8211;may have had on investors and media earlier in her career:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I wanted the focus to be on my work,” she says slowly and deliberately. “I don’t want to go into a meeting and have people looking at what I’m wearing. I want them listening to what I’m saying. And I want them to be looking at what we do.” She pauses, then adds, “Because when you walk into the room and you’re a 19-year-old girl, people interact with you in a certain way.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Prior to the <em>Journal</em> article, Holmes was something of a media darling, appearing on the covers of several national magazines (including <em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\">Fortune</a></em>). Given the paucity of young, female tech founders, there&#8217;s no doubt that her status as woman played some role in that coverage.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Holmes has spoken out on issues related to women in technology. In a <em><a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/inspired/women-of-the-year/2015/elizabeth-holmes\">Glamour</a></em> interview, she credited her parents for encouraging her to play with Legos as well a Barbies, and earlier this year spoke to <em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/elizabeth-holmes-calls-on-women/\">Fortune</a> </em>about her #IronSisters campaign, which she said she created to encourage women to help one another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is ready to take on a new task: closely regulating laboratory developed tests. The reason: such tests &#8220;may have caused or have caused&#8221; actual harm to patients by misdiagnosing potentially serious conditions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;FDA oversight would help ensure that tests are supported by rigorous evidence,&#8221; Peter Lurie, the FDA&#8217;s associate commissioner for public health strategy and analysis, wrote in a blog post. &#8220;That patients and health care providers can have confidence in the test results, and that LDTs have more scientifically accurate product labeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, are used to diagnose various diseases and are designed, manufactured, and used in a single laboratory. They&#8217;ve been around for some time and differ from standard diagnostic tools that require strict regulatory oversight and are widely distributed to doctors&#8217; offices, hospitals, and other laboratories.</p>\n<p>Theranos, a blood-testing company that develops LDTs, captured headlines in recent weeks after <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\" target=\"_blank\">a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> alleged that the company cheated on proficiency tests and suggested that its proprietary LDTs lacked high-levels of consistency and accuracy. CEO Elizabeth Holmes, the subject of <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\" target=\"_blank\">a <em>Fortune</em> cover story</a>, rebutted those allegations and said <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/21/theranos-wsj-defense/\" target=\"_blank\">there was no deception</a>. Holmes has supported FDA regulation of LDTs and said Theranos would voluntarily submit its tests for FDA review, whereas most of the industry has aggressively campaigned against such a move. Theranos already has one FDA approval for its herpes simplex-virus type 1.</p>\n<p>Up until now, the FDA has <a href=\"http://blogs.fda.gov/FDAvoice/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;exercised enforcement discretion&#8221; towards LDTs</a>, meaning that they haven&#8217;t held these tests to the highest level of scrutiny under existing laws. LDTs rarely undergo FDA review to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and confirm that they provide clinically meaningful results.</p>\n<p>The primary reason LDTs flew under the radar until now is that they previously focused on relatively simple tests, usually for rare conditions. However, LDTs have ventured into more and more complex conditions in recent years and are now used to diagnose common and serious medical conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. The effect on patients is much broader, and any misdiagnosis could result in real harm to patients&#8211;and significant public health costs.</p>\n<p>A test could provide a false positive, resulting in unnecessary treatments and mounting costs. But, even more dangerous is a false negative, thus leaving a patient in harm&#8217;s way.</p>\n<p>For instance, one LDT used to detect a HER2 gene mutation, which is connected to an aggressive form of breast cancer that requires special HER2-targeting drugs, failed to detect the mutation about 20% of the time. That means that these patients didn&#8217;t receive the best-in-class treatment, compromising their ability to battle breast cancer. The social cost per each <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/UCM472777.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">false-negative case totaled $775,278</a>, according to analysis by FDA economists.</p>\n<p>The FDA is now stepping in and proposing to step up its oversight of these tests. The agency issued a draft guidance last year and is now working to put the finishing touches on the proposal to phase in implementation of premarket review for LDTs.</p>\n",

Theranos disputes the story. The company&#8217;s general counsel Heather King told the <em>Journal</em>, “We don’t comment on discussions with other companies,&#8221; but that its report on the Safeway deal is &#8220;inaccurate and defamatory.&#8221; The company <a href=\"https://www.theranos.com/news/posts/statement-from-theranos-5\" target=\"_blank\">posted the same response</a> to its web site, writing that it was &#8220;disappointed to see yet another inaccurate WSJ article,&#8221; without actually identifying the story or linking to it.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Theranos directed <em>Fortune </em>to the statement on its web site; a spokesperson for Safeway declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The report comes amid an ongoing scandal over whether Theranos and its founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes misrepresented the company&#8217;s technology.</p>\n<p>The media storm began with a <em>Journal </em><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">story</a> last month that reported Theranos does not use its own technology in the majority of its testing. The company fired back and criticized the story, but since then, Theranos has had to enter a &#8220;pause period&#8221; as partners like Walgreen <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"WAG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/wag/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">WAG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> await further information.

Last week <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/02/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fda/\">Holmes appeared at <em>Fortune’s</em> Global Forum</a> and defended her company. She said Theranos is using just one “finger prick” blood test commercially, but that this was her own cautious decision based on FDA approvals. &#8220;That doesn’t mean we don’t have the technology to do them,” she said. “There’s no reason we can’t do peer review and publish other statistics.”</p>\n<p>For more, see our <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/31/theranos-timeline/\">full timeline of the entire Theranos saga</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4592960749001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4592960749001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1GWL5Q4\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalanmurray%2Cbloodtests%2Celizabethholmes%2Celizabethholmesvideo%2Cfda%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cfortuneglobalforumvideo%2Cglobalforum%2Ctheranos%2Ctheranosbloodtests%2Ctheranosvideo%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

          "content": "<p>As often happens in the anxious weeks before the end of Apple&#8217;s big holiday quarter, talk on the Street has turned to the company&#8217;s Asian supply chain.</p>\n<p>Component orders for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are down, we hear from Apple analysts at Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays and Credit Suisse—with each note&#8217;s release accompanied by another drop in the company&#8217;s share price <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>. Apple&#8217;s shares fell 3.6% Monday morning, for example, after Morgan Stanley<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/morgan-stanley-apple-price/\"> lowered its estimate</a> for the number of iPhone unit sold during the holiday quarter by 6%.</p>\n<p>Whether these are reports of cuts at four separate suppliers or four reports from the same component maker is not entirely clear. The only supplier on record so far is Dialog Semiconductor, which lowered its expectations a bit over 10% Tuesday due to “weaker than anticipated demand in its mobile systems segment.&#8221; Dialog makes a power management circuit for Apple that represents an estimated 75% of Dialog&#8217;s income.</p>\n<p>Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster came to Apple&#8217;s defense. He reminded clients of Tim Cook&#8217;s warning not to rely on any single supply chain estimate. (&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen one that&#8217;s even close to accurate,&#8221; Cook told analysts earlier this year.)</p>\n<p>Besides, Munster added:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;If Dialog&#8217;s guidance was indicative of Mar-16 iPhone units, it would suggest units next quarter would be down 9% y/y compared to recent analyst iPhone cuts predicting Mar-16 down ~15%.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In other words, the Street was expecting an even bigger decline in iPhone sales next quarter than the Dialog warning would imply. </span></p>\n<p>Daniel Eran Dilger, writing for <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/12/15/channel-check-analysts-warning-of-peak-iphone-are-priming-apple-shares-for-monster-buybacks-\">AppleInsider</a>, goes further than Munster. Cataloging a long list of sketchy Apple rumors from the past, he took readers back to December 2012 when a Citibank analyst&#8217;s warning of weak iPhone 5 demand based on &#8220;near-term supply chain orders&#8221; sent Apple shares into a tailspin.</p>\n<p>Writes Dilger:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8220;Not only was that information subsequently found to have been inappropriately leaked to hedge fund SAC Capital, allowing that firm advanced opportunity to profit from the stock selloff Citi&#8217;s predictions triggered, but the information itself was not correct. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5 remained the world&#8217;s top selling smartphone and continued to enjoy rapid sales even as investors began dumping Apple&#8217;s stock on the &#8216;news&#8217; that the phone wasn&#8217;t selling well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dilger is right about the inappropriately leaked data. Citi <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/03/citi-fined-30m-for-leaking-iphone-supply-chain-data\">admitted</a> to the facts and paid a $30 million fine.</p>\n<p>But Citi&#8217;s information may not have been entirely off base. Although the iPhone 5 managed to set a new unit sales record in the 2012 holiday quarter, that was also the quarter when the iPhone&#8217;s extraordinary run of triple-digit sales growth came to an end. The year before, iPhone unit sales grew 128% in Apple&#8217;s fiscal first quarter. In the holiday quarter that Citi was talking about, they only grew 29%.</p>\n<p>That, more than any supply chain report, is what sent Apple into free fall in the winter of 2013.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s expectations are lower this year. The only prediction Tim Cook has made is that Apple will sell more iPhones this quarter than it sold during the same quarter last year. Now, according to the naysayers, even that may be in doubt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Follow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter at </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/philiped\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>@philiped</i></span></a><i>.

          "content": "<p>Some of the people who have the most intimate knowledge on U.S. government intelligence aren&#8217;t so sure encryption is such a bad thing.</p>\n<p>Speaking to the <em>Washington Post</em> in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/former-national-security-officials-urge-government-to-embrace-rise-of-encryption/2015/12/15/3164eae6-a27d-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb_story.html\">interviews</a> published on Tuesday, several former national security officials, including Mike McConnell, who ran the National Security Agency (NSA) in the 1990s and Michael Chertoff, head of Homeland Security from 2005 to 2009, said that the U.S. government&#8217;s obsession with stopping tech companies from encrypting communications is a bad idea. Chertoff went so far as to call efforts at undermining encryption &#8220;misguided.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that deliberately compromising security to make it easier for law enforcement runs the risk of simply sending the bad guys to other parts of the world where things will be fully encrypted,&#8221; Chertoff told the <em>Washington Post</em>. His comments were echoed by McConnell, who told the <em>Post</em> that the NSA has the best electronic communications intelligence in the world and it should &#8220;learn how to deal&#8221; with encryption. Even former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who also led the NSA for six years until 2005, said that blocking encryption would be a disaster.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[We] will wind up with the worst of all worlds,&#8221; he told the <em>Post.</em> &#8220;There will be unbreakable encryption—it just won’t be made by American firms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The comments fly in the face of what the U.S. government, lawmakers, and even presidential hopefuls have been saying over the last couple of years as part of the ongoing debate over encryption.</p>\n<p>Major technology companies, including Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, have fully encrypted communications between their messaging applications. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that his company does not hold the key to unlocking those communications, effectively allowing two people on the company&#8217;s iMessage platform to have a full conversation without fear of anyone seeing what they&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n<p>Several smaller platforms feature similar encryption, including Telegram. After it was discovered last month that <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/telegram-isis-encryption/\">ISIS had been using Telegram for communications</a>, the service quickly responded by shutting down the militant group&#8217;s &#8220;channels.&#8221; Like Apple, Google, and other industry giants, however, Telegram, won&#8217;t provide a so-called &#8220;backdoor&#8221; for governments to use whenever they want to access data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services,&#8221; Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an open letter on his company&#8217;s website. &#8220;We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Encryption has become an increasingly important topic in light of recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Lawmakers and presidential candidates have argued that encryption made the plots easier to plan and harder for government agencies to foil. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/07/hillary-clinton-isis/\">called on technology companies</a> to work with the U.S. government, saying in a speech at the Brookings Institution earlier this month that Silicon Valley should work at &#8220;disrupting ISIS and stopping them from having this open platform for communicating with their dedicated fighters and their wannabes, like the people in San Bernardino.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/20/encryption-debate-paris-attacks/\">Encryption Debate Flares After Paris Attacks</a></strong></p>\n<p>At the Republican Presidential Debate on Tuesday night, encryption was a hot topic. Donald Trump said he would put &#8220;our smartest minds&#8221; to work at &#8220;infiltrating&#8221; terrorist communications. Former New York governor George Pataki said in the &#8220;undercard&#8221; debate that he would push for a law to block companies from encrypting communications. Several of the other candidates also railed against encryption, saying it hinders law enforcement efforts.</p>\n<p>Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, however, said that it&#8217;s a slightly different issue than her competitors argue. She said that if Silicon Valley is asked for help, it would provide that help. Based on comments made by Cook and others, however, it&#8217;s unlikely that those companies would deliver on certain requests, including backdoors.</p>\n<p>While some in the U.S. government may like the hardline talk on encryption, comments made by Chertoff and the others may not sit well with FBI director James Comey.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, the FBI director has railed against technology companies, saying that their encryption is forcing law enforcement officials to &#8220;go dark.&#8221; He&#8217;s called encryption &#8220;a significant public safety problem,&#8221; and said last October that officials &#8220;aren’t always able to access the evidence we need to prosecute crime and prevent terrorism even with lawful authority.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July, he again talked about encryption, saying that while his agency respects &#8220;the fundamental right of people to engage in private communications,&#8221; he&#8217;s concerned that even when a &#8220;communications provider is served with a warrant seeking those communications, the provider cannot provide the data because it has designed the technology such that it cannot be accessed by any third party.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The debate, in other words, is contentious. On one side, companies are saying that in order to protect individual liberty and the privacy of users, they must offer encrypted communication that would prevent them from handing over communications. Law enforcement, along with lawmakers, have argued that such encryption puts people in danger and could protect criminals and terrorists.</p>\n<p>Critics, including Chertoff and the other former national security officials, point to some recent revelations that may undercut the government&#8217;s argument. For one, Tashfeen Malik, one of the alleged San Bernardino attackers, didn&#8217;t use encrypted communications to voice her support for jihad and ISIS. Instead, she is believed to have posted to Facebook, where her comments were readily accessible and unencrypted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A large amount of actionable intelligence still exists and is transferred outside of encrypted technology systems,&#8221; says Ben FitzGerald, director of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. &#8220;Many times we hear that after an attack the perpetrators were already known to our intelligence agencies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>FitzGerald adds that focusing on encryption could cause the U.S. government to fail &#8220;to make use of other tools, including the development of new analysis techniques, that don’t rely on accessing encrypted systems.&#8221; He argues that the comments made by the former officials is &#8220;encouraging&#8221; and suggests that they have developed &#8220;a more detailed understanding of business and technical realities [that] has helped inform their more pragmatic views.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite Comey&#8217;s trouble with tech companies, pragmatism also seems to be gaining popularity within the U.S. government. In comments before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Comey said that while encrypted communications &#8220;must be addressed,&#8221; his agency is now trying a different tack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The United States government is actively engaged with private companies to ensure they understand the public safety and national security risks that result from malicious actors’ use of their encrypted products and services,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Comey added that the Obama administration &#8220;has decided not to seek a legislative remedy at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words, for now, the U.S. government won&#8217;t break companies&#8217; rights to encryption. And based on what cybersecurity officials say, that may just be the best move.</p>\n<p><em>The U.S. government isn&#8217;t the only group monitoring ISIS social media content.

And now it doesn&#8217;t matter anyway: Apple has shut the service down.

              "content": "<p>As often happens in the anxious weeks before the end of Apple&#8217;s big holiday quarter, talk on the Street has turned to the company&#8217;s Asian supply chain.</p>\n<p>Component orders for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are down, we hear from Apple analysts at Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays and Credit Suisse—with each note&#8217;s release accompanied by another drop in the company&#8217;s share price <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>. Apple&#8217;s shares fell 3.6% Monday morning, for example, after Morgan Stanley<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/morgan-stanley-apple-price/\"> lowered its estimate</a> for the number of iPhone unit sold during the holiday quarter by 6%.</p>\n<p>Whether these are reports of cuts at four separate suppliers or four reports from the same component maker is not entirely clear. The only supplier on record so far is Dialog Semiconductor, which lowered its expectations a bit over 10% Tuesday due to “weaker than anticipated demand in its mobile systems segment.&#8221; Dialog makes a power management circuit for Apple that represents an estimated 75% of Dialog&#8217;s income.</p>\n<p>Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster came to Apple&#8217;s defense. He reminded clients of Tim Cook&#8217;s warning not to rely on any single supply chain estimate. (&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen one that&#8217;s even close to accurate,&#8221; Cook told analysts earlier this year.)</p>\n<p>Besides, Munster added:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;If Dialog&#8217;s guidance was indicative of Mar-16 iPhone units, it would suggest units next quarter would be down 9% y/y compared to recent analyst iPhone cuts predicting Mar-16 down ~15%.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In other words, the Street was expecting an even bigger decline in iPhone sales next quarter than the Dialog warning would imply. </span></p>\n<p>Daniel Eran Dilger, writing for <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/12/15/channel-check-analysts-warning-of-peak-iphone-are-priming-apple-shares-for-monster-buybacks-\">AppleInsider</a>, goes further than Munster. Cataloging a long list of sketchy Apple rumors from the past, he took readers back to December 2012 when a Citibank analyst&#8217;s warning of weak iPhone 5 demand based on &#8220;near-term supply chain orders&#8221; sent Apple shares into a tailspin.</p>\n<p>Writes Dilger:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8220;Not only was that information subsequently found to have been inappropriately leaked to hedge fund SAC Capital, allowing that firm advanced opportunity to profit from the stock selloff Citi&#8217;s predictions triggered, but the information itself was not correct. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5 remained the world&#8217;s top selling smartphone and continued to enjoy rapid sales even as investors began dumping Apple&#8217;s stock on the &#8216;news&#8217; that the phone wasn&#8217;t selling well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dilger is right about the inappropriately leaked data. Citi <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/03/citi-fined-30m-for-leaking-iphone-supply-chain-data\">admitted</a> to the facts and paid a $30 million fine.</p>\n<p>But Citi&#8217;s information may not have been entirely off base. Although the iPhone 5 managed to set a new unit sales record in the 2012 holiday quarter, that was also the quarter when the iPhone&#8217;s extraordinary run of triple-digit sales growth came to an end. The year before, iPhone unit sales grew 128% in Apple&#8217;s fiscal first quarter. In the holiday quarter that Citi was talking about, they only grew 29%.</p>\n<p>That, more than any supply chain report, is what sent Apple into free fall in the winter of 2013.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s expectations are lower this year. The only prediction Tim Cook has made is that Apple will sell more iPhones this quarter than it sold during the same quarter last year. Now, according to the naysayers, even that may be in doubt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Follow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter at </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/philiped\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>@philiped</i></span></a><i>.

              "content": "<p>Some of the people who have the most intimate knowledge on U.S. government intelligence aren&#8217;t so sure encryption is such a bad thing.</p>\n<p>Speaking to the <em>Washington Post</em> in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/former-national-security-officials-urge-government-to-embrace-rise-of-encryption/2015/12/15/3164eae6-a27d-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb_story.html\">interviews</a> published on Tuesday, several former national security officials, including Mike McConnell, who ran the National Security Agency (NSA) in the 1990s and Michael Chertoff, head of Homeland Security from 2005 to 2009, said that the U.S. government&#8217;s obsession with stopping tech companies from encrypting communications is a bad idea. Chertoff went so far as to call efforts at undermining encryption &#8220;misguided.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that deliberately compromising security to make it easier for law enforcement runs the risk of simply sending the bad guys to other parts of the world where things will be fully encrypted,&#8221; Chertoff told the <em>Washington Post</em>. His comments were echoed by McConnell, who told the <em>Post</em> that the NSA has the best electronic communications intelligence in the world and it should &#8220;learn how to deal&#8221; with encryption. Even former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who also led the NSA for six years until 2005, said that blocking encryption would be a disaster.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[We] will wind up with the worst of all worlds,&#8221; he told the <em>Post.</em> &#8220;There will be unbreakable encryption—it just won’t be made by American firms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The comments fly in the face of what the U.S. government, lawmakers, and even presidential hopefuls have been saying over the last couple of years as part of the ongoing debate over encryption.</p>\n<p>Major technology companies, including Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, have fully encrypted communications between their messaging applications. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that his company does not hold the key to unlocking those communications, effectively allowing two people on the company&#8217;s iMessage platform to have a full conversation without fear of anyone seeing what they&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n<p>Several smaller platforms feature similar encryption, including Telegram. After it was discovered last month that <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/telegram-isis-encryption/\">ISIS had been using Telegram for communications</a>, the service quickly responded by shutting down the militant group&#8217;s &#8220;channels.&#8221; Like Apple, Google, and other industry giants, however, Telegram, won&#8217;t provide a so-called &#8220;backdoor&#8221; for governments to use whenever they want to access data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services,&#8221; Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an open letter on his company&#8217;s website. &#8220;We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Encryption has become an increasingly important topic in light of recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Lawmakers and presidential candidates have argued that encryption made the plots easier to plan and harder for government agencies to foil. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/07/hillary-clinton-isis/\">called on technology companies</a> to work with the U.S. government, saying in a speech at the Brookings Institution earlier this month that Silicon Valley should work at &#8220;disrupting ISIS and stopping them from having this open platform for communicating with their dedicated fighters and their wannabes, like the people in San Bernardino.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/20/encryption-debate-paris-attacks/\">Encryption Debate Flares After Paris Attacks</a></strong></p>\n<p>At the Republican Presidential Debate on Tuesday night, encryption was a hot topic. Donald Trump said he would put &#8220;our smartest minds&#8221; to work at &#8220;infiltrating&#8221; terrorist communications. Former New York governor George Pataki said in the &#8220;undercard&#8221; debate that he would push for a law to block companies from encrypting communications. Several of the other candidates also railed against encryption, saying it hinders law enforcement efforts.</p>\n<p>Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, however, said that it&#8217;s a slightly different issue than her competitors argue. She said that if Silicon Valley is asked for help, it would provide that help. Based on comments made by Cook and others, however, it&#8217;s unlikely that those companies would deliver on certain requests, including backdoors.</p>\n<p>While some in the U.S. government may like the hardline talk on encryption, comments made by Chertoff and the others may not sit well with FBI director James Comey.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, the FBI director has railed against technology companies, saying that their encryption is forcing law enforcement officials to &#8220;go dark.&#8221; He&#8217;s called encryption &#8220;a significant public safety problem,&#8221; and said last October that officials &#8220;aren’t always able to access the evidence we need to prosecute crime and prevent terrorism even with lawful authority.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July, he again talked about encryption, saying that while his agency respects &#8220;the fundamental right of people to engage in private communications,&#8221; he&#8217;s concerned that even when a &#8220;communications provider is served with a warrant seeking those communications, the provider cannot provide the data because it has designed the technology such that it cannot be accessed by any third party.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The debate, in other words, is contentious. On one side, companies are saying that in order to protect individual liberty and the privacy of users, they must offer encrypted communication that would prevent them from handing over communications. Law enforcement, along with lawmakers, have argued that such encryption puts people in danger and could protect criminals and terrorists.</p>\n<p>Critics, including Chertoff and the other former national security officials, point to some recent revelations that may undercut the government&#8217;s argument. For one, Tashfeen Malik, one of the alleged San Bernardino attackers, didn&#8217;t use encrypted communications to voice her support for jihad and ISIS. Instead, she is believed to have posted to Facebook, where her comments were readily accessible and unencrypted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A large amount of actionable intelligence still exists and is transferred outside of encrypted technology systems,&#8221; says Ben FitzGerald, director of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. &#8220;Many times we hear that after an attack the perpetrators were already known to our intelligence agencies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>FitzGerald adds that focusing on encryption could cause the U.S. government to fail &#8220;to make use of other tools, including the development of new analysis techniques, that don’t rely on accessing encrypted systems.&#8221; He argues that the comments made by the former officials is &#8220;encouraging&#8221; and suggests that they have developed &#8220;a more detailed understanding of business and technical realities [that] has helped inform their more pragmatic views.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite Comey&#8217;s trouble with tech companies, pragmatism also seems to be gaining popularity within the U.S. government. In comments before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Comey said that while encrypted communications &#8220;must be addressed,&#8221; his agency is now trying a different tack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The United States government is actively engaged with private companies to ensure they understand the public safety and national security risks that result from malicious actors’ use of their encrypted products and services,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Comey added that the Obama administration &#8220;has decided not to seek a legislative remedy at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words, for now, the U.S. government won&#8217;t break companies&#8217; rights to encryption. And based on what cybersecurity officials say, that may just be the best move.</p>\n<p><em>The U.S. government isn&#8217;t the only group monitoring ISIS social media content.

At the time, tech outlets wondered why: for its <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/why-did-apple-buy-topsy-2013-12\" target=\"_blank\">search capabilities</a>, or for <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/why-apple-really-acquired-topsy.html\" target=\"_blank\">marketing advantages</a>, or a sign of something bigger coming between Apple and Twitter? Topsy was one of only three authorized resellers of Twitter data. It also allowed for advanced searching of all tweets, a feature many Twitter <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"twtr\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/twtr/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">twtr</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> users had longed for.</p>\n<p>The shut down is not a total shock. About a year ago, the company stopped allowing premium users to renew their paid accounts, making it likely the service would soon disappear.</p>\n<p>Now Topsy is no more—as the company itself announced on Tuesday night in a rather sad tweet—and Apple did not officially announce the move yet, and has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;ve searched our last tweet.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Topsy (@Topsy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Topsy/status/676919759435399168\">December 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"10\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4611167879001-10\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4611167879001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Uz1Brr\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dapple%2Capplebeats%2Capplebeatsmusic%2Capplemusic%2Capplenews%2Cappleshutdownbeatsmusic%2Capplestreaming%2Cbeatsmusic%2Cbeatsmusicnews%2Cbeatsmusicstreaming%2Ctechexplained%2Ctimcook%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechexplained&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

But now one analyst thinks the streaming service could be knocking on the door of one of its biggest rivals by the end of next year.</p>\n<p>A new report from media analyst Mark Mulligan of <a href=\"http://www.midiaresearch.com/research/\">MIDiA Research</a> predicts that Apple Music will end 2015 with just under 8 million paying users and then that total should more than double by the end of 2016 to approach 20 million.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/30/apple-music-first-reviews/\">Some users complained</a> about Apple Music&#8217;s design and some initial bugs when it went live in June. But, the tech giant&#8217;s streaming service <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/20/apple-music-15-million-users/\">said it had picked up a total of 6.5 million paid subscribers</a> by late-October, with another 8.5 million users who were still enjoying the free trial version of the service at that time.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"aapl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">aapl</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> biggest competitor in the streaming music space is Spotify, which said in June it had 20 million paid subscribers and 75 million users overall. Mulligan writes in his report that Spotify will continue to grow its subscriber base over the next year and will still end 2016 as the leading music subscription service, only with Apple hot on its heels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The wildcards in the equation are whether Apple can do a better job of pushing users from iTunes Radio to Apple Music and what happens when Spotify restates its subscriber number to reflect the impact of $1-a-month 3-month trials,&#8221; Mulligan writes in his &#8220;Predictions [for] 2016&#8221; report.</p>\n<p>Spotify recently launched a 99-cent, three-month trial option in an effort to attract even more paid subscribers. Apple Music was able to hang on to roughly 60% of the 11 million users who signed up for its initial free, three-month trial when the service launched at the end of June, successfully converting about 6.5 million of them into paid users.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"22\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4321262854001-22\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4321262854001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P8SZFT\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dapplemusic%2Capplemusicroyalties%2Capplemusicstreaming%2Capplestreaming%2Cmusicroyalties%2Cmusicstreaming%2Cmusicstreamingroyalties%2Cstreamingmusicroyalties%2Cstreamingroyalties%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dapplemusic&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

          "content": "<p>Apple&#8217;s employees are receiving an unusually generous holiday gift from Cupertino this year.</p>\n<p>Apple executive Eddy Cue told employees in a video message Monday that they would be receiving a free nine-month subscription to Apple Music later this month, <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2015/12/14/apple-gifts-employees-with-apple-music/\">according to MacRumors</a>.</p>\n<p>Last week, Apple employees received a free pair of urBeats headphones, which sell for $100. Combined with the $90 streaming music subscription, the retail value of Apple&#8217;s holiday gift this year is $190—worth significantly more than the $60 customized Incase backpack Apple employees received last year.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s annual holiday gift goes out to all of its employees, including retail workers, employees based at in Cupertino, and staffers at international satellite offices. There are 66,000 Apple employees in the United States, including 30,000 retail employees. Apple employs more than 100,000 workers worldwide.</p>\n<p>The free subscription to Apple Music should help Apple&#8217;s retail Geniuses better understand with the service and promote Apple Music more effectively in-store. CEO Tim Cook said in October that Apple Music had <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/20/apple-music-cook/\">6.5 million paying customers</a>, and another 8.5 million in a free three-month trial period, still a fraction of rival streaming service Spotify&#8217;s subscribers.</p>\n<p>Free Beats headphones aren&#8217;t the only bonus staffers received from Apple this year. Cook announced <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/15/apple-rsu-earnings-signal/\">in October</a> that all Apple employees, including retail workers, are newly eligible for restricted stock units, a type of stock grant option that was previously offered only to corporate leadership and product engineers.</p>\n<p>Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> isn&#8217;t the only tech giant to give its employees an annual holiday present. Last year, Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> gave each of its workers a smartwatch. This year, Mountain View topped that present by giving its workers a free Nexus 5X Android smartphone—retail value $329—and if Google employees didn&#8217;t want a new phone, the company offered to make <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3wkbu3/google_employees_are_receiving_a_nexus_5x_for/cxxch8m\">a donation to charity</a> instead.</p>\n\t\t\t<form

          "content": "<p>One of the hottest musical acts in the world is coming to America with a tour that&#8217;s sure to rake in a ton of money.</p>\n<p>Adele, who smashed sales records with her latest album, announced a slate of upcoming U.S. appearances not long after her European tour dates sold out their initial tickets in rapid fashion. The British singer of hits such as &#8220;Hello&#8221; and &#8220;Rolling in the Deep&#8221; <a href=\"http://live.adele.com/north-america/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed on Monday</a> that she&#8217;ll tour North America for the first time since 2011 starting in July with more than 50 performances across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Tickets go on sale Dec. 17.</p>\n<p>Adele&#8217;s new album, <em>25</em>, broke U.S. sales records by selling 3.38 million copies here in its first full week on sale last month. The feat was made all the more impressive by the fact that Adele&#8217;s album needed only four days to break a 15 year-old first-week sales record held by NSync&#8217;s 2000 album <em>No Strings Attached</em>.</p>\n<p>Her impressive record sales also come at a time when even popular artists are selling fewer and fewer albums due to their fans&#8217; increased streaming practices. Adele famously declined to allow streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music stream her new album, though Pandora <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"P\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/p/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">P</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> did get that right and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/25/adele-pandora/\" target=\"_blank\">saw its stock price surge</a> as a result.</p>\n<p>Adele is one of the rare modern artists who can drum up plenty of publicity without streaming her music extensively online, thanks in part to her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/07/adele-hello-marketing-machine/\" target=\"_blank\">powerful marketing support</a>, and her unparalleled popularity is likely to result in more sold out shows (and major revenue) once tickets go on sale in North America. There are even some <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/10/27/adeles-return-could-net-her-a-30m-tour-sponsorship/\" target=\"_blank\">reports that Adele&#8217;s tour could be sponsored</a>—her agents reportedly talked with Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>—in a deal worth as much as $30 million.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"23\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4623855046001-23\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4623855046001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P30IWd\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daarontask%2Cadele%2Cadele25%2Cadelehello%2Cadelespotify%2Cadelestreaming%2Cadelesnewalbum%2Candrewnusca%2Cfortunelive%2Cleighgallagher%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dfortunelive&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

Apple had announced that it wouldn&#8217;t pay artists during its free three-month trial of Apple Music. Following Swift&#8217;s disparaging post, the company <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/apple-taylor-swift/?iid=sr-link5\" target=\"_blank\">overturned its initial decision</a>.</p>\n<p>The musician told Lowe that Apple contacted her about taping a concert performance for a special. &#8220;I think that is probably the starting point,&#8221; Swift said, &#8220;because I didn’t have a personal relationship with Apple until that point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The 1989 World Tour LIVE&#8221; will be released on Dec. 20. The performance was recorded on Nov. 28 at Sydney, Australia&#8217;s ANZ Stadium and includes appearances by Justin Timberlake, Mick Jagger, and Kobe Bryant. Apple Music users will be able to stream the special for free. The service is also the only one on which Swift&#8217;s &#8220;1989&#8221; album can be found.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"24\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4354116513001-24\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4354116513001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RM2UnD\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dapple%2Capplemusic%2Cbrainstormtech%2Ctaylorswift%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dbrainstormtech&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

              "content": "<p>Apple&#8217;s employees are receiving an unusually generous holiday gift from Cupertino this year.</p>\n<p>Apple executive Eddy Cue told employees in a video message Monday that they would be receiving a free nine-month subscription to Apple Music later this month, <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2015/12/14/apple-gifts-employees-with-apple-music/\">according to MacRumors</a>.</p>\n<p>Last week, Apple employees received a free pair of urBeats headphones, which sell for $100. Combined with the $90 streaming music subscription, the retail value of Apple&#8217;s holiday gift this year is $190—worth significantly more than the $60 customized Incase backpack Apple employees received last year.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s annual holiday gift goes out to all of its employees, including retail workers, employees based at in Cupertino, and staffers at international satellite offices. There are 66,000 Apple employees in the United States, including 30,000 retail employees. Apple employs more than 100,000 workers worldwide.</p>\n<p>The free subscription to Apple Music should help Apple&#8217;s retail Geniuses better understand with the service and promote Apple Music more effectively in-store. CEO Tim Cook said in October that Apple Music had <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/20/apple-music-cook/\">6.5 million paying customers</a>, and another 8.5 million in a free three-month trial period, still a fraction of rival streaming service Spotify&#8217;s subscribers.</p>\n<p>Free Beats headphones aren&#8217;t the only bonus staffers received from Apple this year. Cook announced <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/15/apple-rsu-earnings-signal/\">in October</a> that all Apple employees, including retail workers, are newly eligible for restricted stock units, a type of stock grant option that was previously offered only to corporate leadership and product engineers.</p>\n<p>Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> isn&#8217;t the only tech giant to give its employees an annual holiday present. Last year, Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> gave each of its workers a smartwatch. This year, Mountain View topped that present by giving its workers a free Nexus 5X Android smartphone—retail value $329—and if Google employees didn&#8217;t want a new phone, the company offered to make <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3wkbu3/google_employees_are_receiving_a_nexus_5x_for/cxxch8m\">a donation to charity</a> instead.</p>\n\t\t\t<form

              "content": "<p>One of the hottest musical acts in the world is coming to America with a tour that&#8217;s sure to rake in a ton of money.</p>\n<p>Adele, who smashed sales records with her latest album, announced a slate of upcoming U.S. appearances not long after her European tour dates sold out their initial tickets in rapid fashion. The British singer of hits such as &#8220;Hello&#8221; and &#8220;Rolling in the Deep&#8221; <a href=\"http://live.adele.com/north-america/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed on Monday</a> that she&#8217;ll tour North America for the first time since 2011 starting in July with more than 50 performances across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Tickets go on sale Dec. 17.</p>\n<p>Adele&#8217;s new album, <em>25</em>, broke U.S. sales records by selling 3.38 million copies here in its first full week on sale last month. The feat was made all the more impressive by the fact that Adele&#8217;s album needed only four days to break a 15 year-old first-week sales record held by NSync&#8217;s 2000 album <em>No Strings Attached</em>.</p>\n<p>Her impressive record sales also come at a time when even popular artists are selling fewer and fewer albums due to their fans&#8217; increased streaming practices. Adele famously declined to allow streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music stream her new album, though Pandora <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"P\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/p/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">P</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> did get that right and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/25/adele-pandora/\" target=\"_blank\">saw its stock price surge</a> as a result.</p>\n<p>Adele is one of the rare modern artists who can drum up plenty of publicity without streaming her music extensively online, thanks in part to her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/07/adele-hello-marketing-machine/\" target=\"_blank\">powerful marketing support</a>, and her unparalleled popularity is likely to result in more sold out shows (and major revenue) once tickets go on sale in North America. There are even some <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/10/27/adeles-return-could-net-her-a-30m-tour-sponsorship/\" target=\"_blank\">reports that Adele&#8217;s tour could be sponsored</a>—her agents reportedly talked with Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple-5/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>—in a deal worth as much as $30 million.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"2\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4623855046001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4623855046001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P30IWd\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daarontask%2Cadele%2Cadele25%2Cadelehello%2Cadelespotify%2Cadelestreaming%2Cadelesnewalbum%2Candrewnusca%2Cfortunelive%2Cleighgallagher%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dfortunelive&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&#038;blog=64089429&#038;post=1479378&#038;subd=fortunedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

Apple had announced that it wouldn&#8217;t pay artists during its free three-month trial of Apple Music. Following Swift&#8217;s disparaging post, the company <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/apple-taylor-swift/?iid=sr-link5\" target=\"_blank\">overturned its initial decision</a>.</p>\n<p>The musician told Lowe that Apple contacted her about taping a concert performance for a special. &#8220;I think that is probably the starting point,&#8221; Swift said, &#8220;because I didn’t have a personal relationship with Apple until that point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The 1989 World Tour LIVE&#8221; will be released on Dec. 20. The performance was recorded on Nov. 28 at Sydney, Australia&#8217;s ANZ Stadium and includes appearances by Justin Timberlake, Mick Jagger, and Kobe Bryant. Apple Music users will be able to stream the special for free.

          "content": "<p>After nine months of speculation and obfuscation, Hideo Kojima, one of the video game industry&#8217;s most respected developers, is finally, officially divorced from Konami. And Sony wasted no time in scooping him up.</p>\n<p>The company has announced an agreement that will see Kojima&#8217;s newly formed Kojima Productions develop its first title exclusively for the PlayStation 4.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He is one of the most creative talents in the history of games,&#8221; said Andrew House, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SNE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/sne/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SNE</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=annuTcmB1rw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video announcing the partnership</a>. &#8220;Kojima-san, on behalf of PlayStation and together with the fans, we&#8217;d like to offer our full support on your new journey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kojima&#8217; is the creator of both the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em> franchises—two of the biggest games in Konami&#8217;s catalog. The <em>MGS</em> franchise has sold more than 46 million copies, with this year&#8217;s <em>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</em> selling 5 million copies as of September.</p>\n<p>His departure from Konami <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KNM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/knm/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KNM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> is a momentous shift in the industry. Imagine, for example, if Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo went their separate ways. It was long telegraphed, though—and shrouded in mysterious moves, vague statements, and apparent internal chaos.</p>\n<p>The question of his fate arose in March, when Kojima&#8217;s name was removed from the Konami website. In July, it was taken off of the box art for <em>Metal Gear Solid 5</em>. His studio, Kojima Productions, was shut down as well. But as enthusiastic press and fans asked what it all meant, the company deflected questions—issuing just a terse statement reading &#8220;Konami Digital Entertainment, including Mr. Kojima, will continue to develop and support Metal Gear products. Please look forward to future announcements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last month, tensions hit a peak when <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/konami-booed-at-game-awards/\">Konami attorneys blocked him from picking up an award</a> for <em>MGS 5</em>. Yesterday, Kojima confirmed, via Twitter, that his 30 year relationship with the company was officially over.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/Lm04m6BNB1\">pic.twitter.com/Lm04m6BNB1</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/677005334402220032\">December 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>The arrangement between Sony and Kojima is, at present, for just one game. And in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PadPoet/sony-computer-entertainment-enters-into-an-agreement-with-kojima-productions-1490ebd29c45#.zb809geai\">Q&amp;A on Medium</a>, a representative said Sony is not investing in the studio. (The title will be console exclusive to the PS4, but will launch on PC at a later date.) Since Konami owns the rights to both <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em>, Kojima&#8217;s next game will be a new franchise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to embark on creating a new franchise with PlayStation that will give you all a new and innovative gaming experience, so please stay tuned,&#8221; said Kojima.</p>\n<p>While speculation has been that Kojima would likely land in some sort of relationship with Sony when he was finally free of Konami, analysts say the announcement is still a big feather in the company&#8217;s cap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an incremental positive,&#8221; says Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Co. &#8220;Exclusive games can still be a differentiator for the console side. He is amazingly talented and you can expect his next game to most likely be great. It&#8217;s a talent driven business. We get excited about hardware, but we spend seven or eight years playing games—and he&#8217;s one of the best game makers out there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The relationship is yet another coup for Sony, which has signed several notable Japanese developers to make <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/17/sony-e3-core-gamers/\">exclusive games</a> on the PS4, including Yu Suzuki&#8217;s <em>Shenmue 3</em> and Fumito Ueda&#8217;s <em>The Last Guardian</em>.</p>\n<p>Life to date, the PS4 has sold <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/25/playstation-4-sets-console-sales-records/\">more than 30.2 million units</a>, making it the fastest selling system in the history of the PlayStation brand—even eclipsing the storied PS2. And the pace of consumer adoption is only increasing. Since the beginning of the year, Sony has sold more than 12 million PS4s. That&#8217;s more than double the estimated number of Xbox One consoles that have been sold.</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about future Playstation content, watch this Fortune video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"26\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4093453805001-26\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4093453805001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RoA2CG\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalabama%2Cbenefitscut%2Ccalifornia%2Cdoctorsopinions%2Cflorida%2Cinsurancecompanies%2Cinsurers%2Cinvestigation%2Cjointinvestigation%2Cnpr%2Cpropublica%2Cworkerscompensation%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dworkerscompensation&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

          "content": "<p>Two months after archrival Activision-Blizzard announced plans to focus on eSports, video game giant Electronic Arts <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/electronic-arts-671/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> is following suit.</p>\n<p>The game publisher unveiled a competitive gaming division late Thursday, and upped the stakes by tapping one of its highest profile executives to run the unit. Peter Moore, EA&#8217;s chief operating officer and the former head of Microsoft&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Xbox subsidiary, will oversee the division, which will utilize EA&#8217;s biggest franchises—including <em>FIFA, Madden NFL,</em> and <em>Battlefield—</em>in professional gaming events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no one better in our industry to lead this new effort than Peter,&#8221; EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a href=\"http://www.ea.com/news/announcing-the-ea-competitive-gaming-division-led-by-peter-moore\">in a blog post</a>. &#8220;He was an early pioneer in championing competitive gaming programs, such as the FIFA Interactive World Cup and the EA SPORTS Challenge Series, and Peter’s personal passions for the player experience, sports and competition, make him a tremendous leader for this new division.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By tapping internal talent for the eSports unit, even someone as widely respected and beloved in the gaming community as Moore, EA is positioning its entry into the field differently than Activision <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ATVI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/activision-blizzard-585/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ATVI</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>.</p>\n<p>The publisher of <em>Call of Duty</em> looked outside the company to build its eSports division, luring Steve Bornstein, former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network, to serve as chairman, with Mike Sepso, co-founder of Major League Gaming, as his right hand. That pointed at a broad media strategy, with a focus on eSports broadcasting.</p>\n<p>EA avoided discussing specific plans for its unit, though it did say it planned to pursue broadcast events as well.</p>\n<p>While virtual reality has captured more mainstream attention this year, there&#8217;s a big push within the gaming industry for eSports. Although there&#8217;s not a lot of money in the field at present (compared with overall totals)—and most of that is going to players and Twitch, which broadcasts the majority of the competitions—the potential is vast.</p>\n<p>In August, competitors in a tournament for <em>Dota 2</em> split an $18 million prize pool. And 36 million people watched the finals match for <em>League of Legends</em> in October.</p>\n<p>R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian expects eSports revenues to reach $1 billion by 2018—a big leap from an expected $200 million this year. There are significant opportunities with tournaments, advertising and sponsorships, broadcast contracts, and wagering.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For EA, we estimate that revenue and engagement opportunities from eSports could add 20 to 30 cents in EPS over the next few years,&#8221; Sebastian says.</p>\n<p>Just as important, eSports is a marketing gold mine. The promotional value of the games played in tournaments is immense. According to Newzoo, there are 226 million eSports fans around the globe today and that number will increase to 323 million by 2018. And those fans want to play what the pros play.</p>\n<p>That made EA&#8217;s entry into the field a fait accompli once Activision went public with its eSports plans. Failing to do so would essentially have given the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise a free ride to continue dominating the sales charts.</p>\n<p>While EA has been involved in eSports perhaps longer than any other publisher, it has failed to capitalize on that history and remained a small player in the market.</p>\n<p>The choice of Moore to head the division is being widely praised. He was a prominent figure at Sega during that company&#8217;s launch of the heralded Dreamcast, eventually being promoted to president and COO of Sega of America. While at Microsoft, he helped position the Xbox 360 as the dominant console brand, steering the unit through what could have been a disastrous start when <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2007/08/23/report-new-xbox-360-with-smaller-chips-could-cause-inventory-headache/\">engineering problems</a> resulted in many early units to overheat and lock up.</p>\n<p>Since joining EA in 2007, he has run the company&#8217;s sports division and occupied the COO role, but has also helped mend the publisher&#8217;s reputation with gamers, who were frustrated with the quality of many of its games in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In our view, Peter Moore, as a long-term top executive, brings the necessary vision, legitimacy, and visibility to set the division up for success,&#8221; says Sebastian.</p>\n<p><em>Find out how tech execs, including EA&#8217;s Andrew Wilson, unplug from work in this </em>Fortune<em> video: </em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"27\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4579598923001-27\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4579598923001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1OVYt8M\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dandrewwilson%2Cbirchbox%2Cblakeirving%2Cbrazilianjiujitsu%2Cchriscurtin%2Cchristopheryoung%2Ccyphyworks%2Cdollarshaveclub%2Celectronicarts%2Cfitbit%2Cgodaddy%2Cgrokker%2Chelengreiner%2Cintel%2Cjpmorganchase%2Cjamespark%2Ckatiabeauchamp%2Clarsbjork%2Clornaborenstein%2Cmichaeldubin%2Cmichaellee%2Cmyfitnesspal%2Cnoahwintroub%2Cqlik%2Cquentinclark%2Csap%2Cscottgrimes%2Cslack%2Cstewartbutterfield%2Ctechceos%2Ctechcetera%2Ctechcetera%2Cunplugingfromwork%2Cvisa%2Cwoven%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechcetera&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\"><em>Subscribe to Data Sheet</em></a><em>, </em>Fortune’s<em> daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

Players have increasingly shown an interest in off-the-beaten-path games in addition to long-running hit franchises.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is YouTube—and you can&#8217;t have a top 10 list without several gaming-themed videos that are original clips, rather than just marketing reels. Among the favorites were a real-life recreation of scenes from <em>Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V)</em>, a playthrough of <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3</em> (which reduced the onscreen player to a quivering mass), and a video that captured the first impressions of senior citizens as they play <em>GTA V</em> for the first time.</p>\n<p>In addition to running down the top videos, YouTube also pulled back the curtain on the demographics for its gaming audience. Thirty percent of YouTube&#8217;s gamers are women, with one third of its members over the age of 35. Gamers are also growing up, with 47% of the 4,800 people YouTube surveyed saying they are now parents.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the complete list of the most-watched videos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC2qk2X3fKA\">Clash of Clans: Revenge (Official Super Bowl TV Commercial)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZZquVylLEo\">Real GTA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwWLns7-xN8\">Star Wars Battlefront Reveal Trailer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdHlIy0W4uU\">Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3 Teaser Trailer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB_4BnQe-qc\">WARNING: YOU WILL DIE | Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3 &#8211; Part 1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs\">Discover Pokémon in the Real World with Pokémon GO!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4\">Fallout 4 &#8211; Official Trailer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHoOrFdgYR8\">Elders Play Grand Theft Auto V (Elders React: Gaming)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-QTsRAz1Bo\">Halo VS Call of Duty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kznek1uNVsg\">Final Fantasy VII &#8211; E3 2015 Trailer | PS4</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>.<br />\nThere is some redeeming news for Activision-Blizzard <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ATVI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/activision-blizzard-585/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ATVI</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>. While the company&#8217;s <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> videos didn&#8217;t go viral, YouTube&#8217;s overall gaming audience still love it. In terms of total views and watch time, the game managed to top the list of titles that captured people&#8217;s attention this year, with <em>FIFA 16</em> coming in second.</p>\n<p>Even in that ranking, though, independent and smaller games had a phenomenal showing. <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3</em> and <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 4 </em>both made the list, as did <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em> and <em>Agar.io;</em> titles that most non-core gamers have never heard of. Meanwhile, some of the year&#8217;s biggest releases, including <em>Halo 5: Guardians</em> and <em>Star Wars: Battlefront</em>, were absent from the list.</p>\n<p>The video game world is becoming increasingly important to YouTube. In August, the company <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/youtube-gaming-channel-vs-twitch/\">launched a game streaming service</a> to compete with Amazon&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Twitch. The company says people currently watch <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/25/youtubes-twitch-gaming/\">billions of hours of gaming</a> on its service each month, and that half of its top 100 channels are gaming-focused.</p>\n<p><i>Make sure to</i><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/philip-elmer-dewitt\" target=\"_blank\"><i> s</i></a><i><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\" target=\"_blank\">ign up for Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter about the business of technology.</i></p>\n<p><i>For more on video games and Activision Blizzard&#8217;s recent acquisition of Candy Crush, please check out the following Fortune video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"28\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4594053507001-28\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4594053507001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/21OFSRs\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dactivision%2Cactivisionblizzard%2Cblizzard%2Ccallofduty%2Ccandycrush%2Ccandycrushsaga%2Ccandycrushsodasaga%2Cking%2Ckingdigitalentertainment%2Cworldofwarcraft%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dcandycrush&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

              "content": "<p>After nine months of speculation and obfuscation, Hideo Kojima, one of the video game industry&#8217;s most respected developers, is finally, officially divorced from Konami. And Sony wasted no time in scooping him up.</p>\n<p>The company has announced an agreement that will see Kojima&#8217;s newly formed Kojima Productions develop its first title exclusively for the PlayStation 4.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He is one of the most creative talents in the history of games,&#8221; said Andrew House, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SNE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/sne/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SNE</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=annuTcmB1rw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video announcing the partnership</a>. &#8220;Kojima-san, on behalf of PlayStation and together with the fans, we&#8217;d like to offer our full support on your new journey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kojima&#8217; is the creator of both the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em> franchises—two of the biggest games in Konami&#8217;s catalog. The <em>MGS</em> franchise has sold more than 46 million copies, with this year&#8217;s <em>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</em> selling 5 million copies as of September.</p>\n<p>His departure from Konami <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KNM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/knm/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KNM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> is a momentous shift in the industry. Imagine, for example, if Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo went their separate ways. It was long telegraphed, though—and shrouded in mysterious moves, vague statements, and apparent internal chaos.</p>\n<p>The question of his fate arose in March, when Kojima&#8217;s name was removed from the Konami website. In July, it was taken off of the box art for <em>Metal Gear Solid 5</em>. His studio, Kojima Productions, was shut down as well. But as enthusiastic press and fans asked what it all meant, the company deflected questions—issuing just a terse statement reading &#8220;Konami Digital Entertainment, including Mr. Kojima, will continue to develop and support Metal Gear products. Please look forward to future announcements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last month, tensions hit a peak when <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/konami-booed-at-game-awards/\">Konami attorneys blocked him from picking up an award</a> for <em>MGS 5</em>. Yesterday, Kojima confirmed, via Twitter, that his 30 year relationship with the company was officially over.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/Lm04m6BNB1\">pic.twitter.com/Lm04m6BNB1</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/677005334402220032\">December 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>The arrangement between Sony and Kojima is, at present, for just one game. And in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PadPoet/sony-computer-entertainment-enters-into-an-agreement-with-kojima-productions-1490ebd29c45#.zb809geai\">Q&amp;A on Medium</a>, a representative said Sony is not investing in the studio. (The title will be console exclusive to the PS4, but will launch on PC at a later date.) Since Konami owns the rights to both <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em>, Kojima&#8217;s next game will be a new franchise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to embark on creating a new franchise with PlayStation that will give you all a new and innovative gaming experience, so please stay tuned,&#8221; said Kojima.</p>\n<p>While speculation has been that Kojima would likely land in some sort of relationship with Sony when he was finally free of Konami, analysts say the announcement is still a big feather in the company&#8217;s cap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an incremental positive,&#8221; says Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Co. &#8220;Exclusive games can still be a differentiator for the console side. He is amazingly talented and you can expect his next game to most likely be great. It&#8217;s a talent driven business. We get excited about hardware, but we spend seven or eight years playing games—and he&#8217;s one of the best game makers out there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The relationship is yet another coup for Sony, which has signed several notable Japanese developers to make <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/17/sony-e3-core-gamers/\">exclusive games</a> on the PS4, including Yu Suzuki&#8217;s <em>Shenmue 3</em> and Fumito Ueda&#8217;s <em>The Last Guardian</em>.</p>\n<p>Life to date, the PS4 has sold <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/25/playstation-4-sets-console-sales-records/\">more than 30.2 million units</a>, making it the fastest selling system in the history of the PlayStation brand—even eclipsing the storied PS2. And the pace of consumer adoption is only increasing. Since the beginning of the year, Sony has sold more than 12 million PS4s. That&#8217;s more than double the estimated number of Xbox One consoles that have been sold.</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about future Playstation content, watch this Fortune video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"2\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4093453805001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4093453805001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RoA2CG\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalabama%2Cbenefitscut%2Ccalifornia%2Cdoctorsopinions%2Cflorida%2Cinsurancecompanies%2Cinsurers%2Cinvestigation%2Cjointinvestigation%2Cnpr%2Cpropublica%2Cworkerscompensation%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dworkerscompensation&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&#038;blog=64089429&#038;post=1484953&#038;subd=fortunedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

              "content": "<p>Two months after archrival Activision-Blizzard announced plans to focus on eSports, video game giant Electronic Arts <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/electronic-arts-671/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> is following suit.</p>\n<p>The game publisher unveiled a competitive gaming division late Thursday, and upped the stakes by tapping one of its highest profile executives to run the unit. Peter Moore, EA&#8217;s chief operating officer and the former head of Microsoft&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Xbox subsidiary, will oversee the division, which will utilize EA&#8217;s biggest franchises—including <em>FIFA, Madden NFL,</em> and <em>Battlefield—</em>in professional gaming events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no one better in our industry to lead this new effort than Peter,&#8221; EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a href=\"http://www.ea.com/news/announcing-the-ea-competitive-gaming-division-led-by-peter-moore\">in a blog post</a>. &#8220;He was an early pioneer in championing competitive gaming programs, such as the FIFA Interactive World Cup and the EA SPORTS Challenge Series, and Peter’s personal passions for the player experience, sports and competition, make him a tremendous leader for this new division.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By tapping internal talent for the eSports unit, even someone as widely respected and beloved in the gaming community as Moore, EA is positioning its entry into the field differently than Activision <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ATVI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/activision-blizzard-585/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ATVI</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>.</p>\n<p>The publisher of <em>Call of Duty</em> looked outside the company to build its eSports division, luring Steve Bornstein, former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network, to serve as chairman, with Mike Sepso, co-founder of Major League Gaming, as his right hand. That pointed at a broad media strategy, with a focus on eSports broadcasting.</p>\n<p>EA avoided discussing specific plans for its unit, though it did say it planned to pursue broadcast events as well.</p>\n<p>While virtual reality has captured more mainstream attention this year, there&#8217;s a big push within the gaming industry for eSports. Although there&#8217;s not a lot of money in the field at present (compared with overall totals)—and most of that is going to players and Twitch, which broadcasts the majority of the competitions—the potential is vast.</p>\n<p>In August, competitors in a tournament for <em>Dota 2</em> split an $18 million prize pool. And 36 million people watched the finals match for <em>League of Legends</em> in October.</p>\n<p>R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian expects eSports revenues to reach $1 billion by 2018—a big leap from an expected $200 million this year. There are significant opportunities with tournaments, advertising and sponsorships, broadcast contracts, and wagering.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For EA, we estimate that revenue and engagement opportunities from eSports could add 20 to 30 cents in EPS over the next few years,&#8221; Sebastian says.</p>\n<p>Just as important, eSports is a marketing gold mine. The promotional value of the games played in tournaments is immense. According to Newzoo, there are 226 million eSports fans around the globe today and that number will increase to 323 million by 2018. And those fans want to play what the pros play.</p>\n<p>That made EA&#8217;s entry into the field a fait accompli once Activision went public with its eSports plans. Failing to do so would essentially have given the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise a free ride to continue dominating the sales charts.</p>\n<p>While EA has been involved in eSports perhaps longer than any other publisher, it has failed to capitalize on that history and remained a small player in the market.</p>\n<p>The choice of Moore to head the division is being widely praised. He was a prominent figure at Sega during that company&#8217;s launch of the heralded Dreamcast, eventually being promoted to president and COO of Sega of America. While at Microsoft, he helped position the Xbox 360 as the dominant console brand, steering the unit through what could have been a disastrous start when <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2007/08/23/report-new-xbox-360-with-smaller-chips-could-cause-inventory-headache/\">engineering problems</a> resulted in many early units to overheat and lock up.</p>\n<p>Since joining EA in 2007, he has run the company&#8217;s sports division and occupied the COO role, but has also helped mend the publisher&#8217;s reputation with gamers, who were frustrated with the quality of many of its games in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In our view, Peter Moore, as a long-term top executive, brings the necessary vision, legitimacy, and visibility to set the division up for success,&#8221; says Sebastian.</p>\n<p><em>Find out how tech execs, including EA&#8217;s Andrew Wilson, unplug from work in this </em>Fortune<em> video: </em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"3\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4579598923001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4579598923001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1OVYt8M\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dandrewwilson%2Cbirchbox%2Cblakeirving%2Cbrazilianjiujitsu%2Cchriscurtin%2Cchristopheryoung%2Ccyphyworks%2Cdollarshaveclub%2Celectronicarts%2Cfitbit%2Cgodaddy%2Cgrokker%2Chelengreiner%2Cintel%2Cjpmorganchase%2Cjamespark%2Ckatiabeauchamp%2Clarsbjork%2Clornaborenstein%2Cmichaeldubin%2Cmichaellee%2Cmyfitnesspal%2Cnoahwintroub%2Cqlik%2Cquentinclark%2Csap%2Cscottgrimes%2Cslack%2Cstewartbutterfield%2Ctechceos%2Ctechcetera%2Ctechcetera%2Cunplugingfromwork%2Cvisa%2Cwoven%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechcetera&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\"><em>Subscribe to Data Sheet</em></a><em>, </em>Fortune’s<em> daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&#038;blog=64089429&#038;post=1475370&#038;subd=fortunedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

In other words, the top 10 gaming videos are the ones that went the most viral this year.</p>\n<p>While the full list did include several AAA titles (<span class=\"st\">those with the highest development and promotion budgets)</span>, including the reveal trailer for EA&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/electronic-arts-671/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> <em>Star Wars: Battlefront</em>, some smaller games held their own against multi-million dollar competitors. The teaser trailer for the independent horror game <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3 </em>proved more popular than reveals for Bethesda&#8217;s long-awaited <em>Fallout 4</em> (which <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/16/fallout4-is-quiet-best-seller/\">claimed a $750 million launch</a> in November) and <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s likely not a worrisome sign for publishers and instead simply an indication of the wildly varied tastes of the industry&#8217;s millennial gaming audience. Players have increasingly shown an interest in off-the-beaten-path games in addition to long-running hit franchises.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is YouTube—and you can&#8217;t have a top 10 list without several gaming-themed videos that are original clips, rather than just marketing reels. Among the favorites were a real-life recreation of scenes from <em>Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V)</em>, a playthrough of <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3</em> (which reduced the onscreen player to a quivering mass), and a video that captured the first impressions of senior citizens as they play <em>GTA V</em> for the first time.</p>\n<p>In addition to running down the top videos, YouTube also pulled back the curtain on the demographics for its gaming audience. Thirty percent of YouTube&#8217;s gamers are women, with one third of its members over the age of 35. Gamers are also growing up, with 47% of the 4,800 people YouTube surveyed saying they are now parents.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the complete list of the most-watched videos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC2qk2X3fKA\">Clash of Clans: Revenge (Official Super Bowl TV Commercial)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZZquVylLEo\">Real GTA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwWLns7-xN8\">Star Wars Battlefront Reveal Trailer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdHlIy0W4uU\">Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3 Teaser Trailer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB_4BnQe-qc\">WARNING: YOU WILL DIE | Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3 &#8211; Part 1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs\">Discover Pokémon in the Real World with Pokémon GO!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4\">Fallout 4 &#8211; Official Trailer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHoOrFdgYR8\">Elders Play Grand Theft Auto V (Elders React: Gaming)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-QTsRAz1Bo\">Halo VS Call of Duty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kznek1uNVsg\">Final Fantasy VII &#8211; E3 2015 Trailer | PS4</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>.<br />\nThere is some redeeming news for Activision-Blizzard <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ATVI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/activision-blizzard-585/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ATVI</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>. While the company&#8217;s <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> videos didn&#8217;t go viral, YouTube&#8217;s overall gaming audience still love it. In terms of total views and watch time, the game managed to top the list of titles that captured people&#8217;s attention this year, with <em>FIFA 16</em> coming in second.</p>\n<p>Even in that ranking, though, independent and smaller games had a phenomenal showing. <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 3</em> and <em>Five Nights at Freddy&#8217;s 4 </em>both made the list, as did <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em> and <em>Agar.io;</em> titles that most non-core gamers have never heard of. Meanwhile, some of the year&#8217;s biggest releases, including <em>Halo 5: Guardians</em> and <em>Star Wars: Battlefront</em>, were absent from the list.</p>\n<p>The video game world is becoming increasingly important to YouTube. In August, the company <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/youtube-gaming-channel-vs-twitch/\">launched a game streaming service</a> to compete with Amazon&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Twitch. The company says people currently watch <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/25/youtubes-twitch-gaming/\">billions of hours of gaming</a> on its service each month, and that half of its top 100 channels are gaming-focused.</p>\n<p><i>Make sure to</i><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/philip-elmer-dewitt\" target=\"_blank\"><i> s</i></a><i><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\" target=\"_blank\">ign up for Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter about the business of technology.</i></p>\n<p><i>For more on video games and Activision Blizzard&#8217;s recent acquisition of Candy Crush, please check out the following Fortune video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"4\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4594053507001-4\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4594053507001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/21OFSRs\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dactivision%2Cactivisionblizzard%2Cblizzard%2Ccallofduty%2Ccandycrush%2Ccandycrushsaga%2Ccandycrushsodasaga%2Cking%2Ckingdigitalentertainment%2Cworldofwarcraft%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dcandycrush&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&#038;blog=64089429&#038;post=1470188&#038;subd=fortunedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

          "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Airbus has</span><span class=\"s1\"> sold more than 1,000 aircraft in the first 11 months of this year, making the European aerospace giant more or less a lock to win its annual order competition with rival Boeing </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“BA”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ba/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“BA”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span></span><span class=\"s1\">. But with deliveries lagging, Airbus will almost certainly fail to meet its production targets for 2015, letting Boeing hold onto the “world’s largest plane maker” crown.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In terms of aircraft orders, Airbus outsold Boeing 1,007 to 568, excluding cancellations. Boeing, meanwhile, out-delivered Airbus by a wide margin, with 709 aircraft delivered over the same period. Airbus handed over the keys to just 556 aircraft in the first 11 months of the year, leaving it 74 aircraft short of its 2015 production target.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Given that Airbus is averaging 50 aircraft per month in 2015, it would have to lift production rates by roughly 50% to hit its end-of year target. Meanwhile Boeing is on target to produce the 750 to 755 aircraft it set out deliver this year, though it has some work to do if the company is going to fulfill its goal of selling as many aircraft as it produces in 2015.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the lopsided order book suggests Airbus is trouncing Boeing sales, a deeper reading of the numbers tells a more nuanced story, says Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at aerospace consultancy Teal Group.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Boeing’s actually a little bit ahead,” he says. “The idea of looking at any one year—it’s fun for bragging rights but otherwise it’s completely meaningless when </span><span class=\"s1\">you’ve got an industry with 12,000 jets on backlog</span><span class=\"s1\">. What you’ve got is a situation where Airbus is a little ahead in number of tails, but Boeing is slightly ahead in value. Airbus has a better position in the narrow-body market, Boeing is ahead in wide-body, and together it works out to be about 50-50.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Airbus has enjoyed strong sales over the last several years, particularly for the latest iteration of its popular A320 narrow-body jet&#8211;the A320neo&#8211;which will begin commercial operation next month. But the company has had trouble keeping pace on the production side. Deliveries of its wide-body A350 lag 2015 projections, with just 11 of the jets delivered so far in 2015 (four short of the company’s target). Airbus plans to deliver 30 A350s in 2016 even as Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier has acknowledged that suppliers are already having trouble coping with</span><span class=\"s1\"> Airbus’s increased rate of production on the A350 line.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That could spell trouble for the company going into 2016, though there’s plenty of good news for Airbus in the latest batch of industry numbers. Airbus’s strong position relative to Boeing in the narrow-body jetliner market persists. As Boeing hosted media at its Everett, Wash., manufacturing facility on Monday and Tuesday for a public unveiling of its new 737MAX narrow-body airliner, numbers released by Airbus showed that it has grabbed 60% of the market for fuel-efficient, smaller-body jets. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That market segment that continues to boom thanks to demand for short-haul air travel routes in Asia and elsewhere. And with Boeing&#8217;s 737MAX slated to enter service no sooner than 2017, Airbus has time to press its advantage. Boeing has sold just 292 jets in the 737MAX family thus far this year, compared with 781 in the same period last year. Airbus logged 825 orders for the A320neo, up from 782 the year before. All said, Airbus has 4,443 A320neos, while Boeing has just shy of 3,000 737MAX jets on order.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether or not Airbus can retain that market advantage will depend on several factors, not least each company’s ability to execute its aggressive manufacturing programs. Both Airbus and Boeing are pushing manufacturing rates skyward as orders continue to swell. But from an investor standpoint, Aboulafia says, the factors that could have the biggest impact on the industry are completely out of their CEOs’ hands: fuel prices and interest rates. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If oil prices remain low and the cost of borrowing inches upward, the industry could quickly find itself in trouble, he says. When fuel is costly and cash is cheap, it makes a lot of sense for airlines to look at replacing older, less efficient airplanes with newer, more efficient models. But if the environment changes, airlines may be less likely to buy new planes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“We’ve been living in this incredibly perfect environment for seven or eight years now where cash is almost free and there’s every reason in the world to replace your older aircraft,&#8221; Aboulafia says. &#8220;One of those is changing and the other one could well change.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more about Airbus, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"31\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4427044899001-31\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4427044899001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1SMEB77\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/international_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daerodynamicimprovements%2Cairbus%2Cairbusa320neo%2Cairlineraddsplanes%2Cbloomberg%2Cdomesticairline%2Cgrowingaviationmarket%2Cindia%2Cindiaairtravel%2Cindianairtravel%2Cindiangovernmentapprovesplaneaddition%2Cindigo%2Cindigoaddstoairfleet%2Cindigoairbusdeal%2Cindigobudgettravel%2Clessfuel%26ch%3Dinternational%26topic%3Dindigo&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

          "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Congress has revived the dormant Export-Import Bank following a five-month hiatus as part of its passage of a $305 billion federal highway bill on Thursday. The federal agency, commonly known as the “Ex-Im” bank, ceased operation in June after lawmakers allowed its authorization to expire.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Supporters of the bank managed to tuck a provision extending the bank’s authorization through September 2019 into the must-pass transportation spending bill (without it, federal highway funding would have run out today). President Obama is expected to sign the bill today, reviving Ex-Im and boosting the fortunes of companies like Boeing </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“BA”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ba/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“BA”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span></span><span class=\"s1\">, General Electric </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“GE”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ge/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“GE”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span></span><span class=\"s1\">, and Caterpillar </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“CAT”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/cat/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“CAT”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> </span><span class=\"s1\">that rely on the bank’s federal loan guarantees for foreign buyers of U.S. goods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boeing and General Electric, in particular, took center-stage in the lobbying battle waged on behalf of Ex-Im alongside the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Those industry groups insist Ex-Im is necessary to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. firms in the global marketplace since most of their overseas competitors benefit from the same kind of government help.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“In recent weeks, we’ve seen how American companies are forced to operate at a unique disadvantage in global markets without Ex-Im, resulting in lost sales and lost jobs,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donahue said in a statement following the House’s passage of the bill. “We applaud the determined work of those Congressional leaders who have acted to protect the competitiveness of American companies.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, Congressional conservatives that oppose Ex-Im have vowed to continue the fight against what they view as corporate welfare.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Export-Import Bank is an executive branch agency that provides the financing tools—typically in the form of loan guarantees—to foreign governments and companies interested in purchasing American goods. While the bank provides financial backing for purchases of all kinds of manufactured products, it tends to favor the makers of large, capital equipment. As such, companies that sell things like commercial airliners, jet engines, construction equipment, and electrical grid infrastructure benefit disproportionately from Ex-Im’s loan guarantees.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boeing is by far the biggest beneficiary of Ex-Im financing, with 14% of its 2014 orders backstopped by the agency. Likewise, General Electric and construction equipment maker Caterpillar have a stake in Ex-Im’s continued existence. Between them, the three companies account for the majority of the bank’s financing, which totaled more than $20 billion last year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That’s led a bloc of conservative lawmakers as well influential groups including Freedom Partners (backed by the billionaire Koch brothers) and the conservative Heritage Foundation to label Ex-Im corporate welfare that benefits a few specific companies more than it benefits taxpayers. As Republican presidential candidates aligned against the bank earlier this year, Tea Party conservatives in Congress maneuvered to keep Ex-Im’s renewal off the House and Senate floors even though the majority of lawmakers continued to support it. When Ex-Im&#8217;s authorization came up for renewal in June, Congress failed to act and Ex-Im’s charter expired at the end of the month.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the months since, Boeing and GE have mounted an <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/25/boeing-export-import-bank/\">intense lobbying campaign</a> for Ex-Im’s renewal and pulled Super PAC donations and other financial contributions to lawmakers that oppose the bank. The bank’s allies tried to attach a provision renewing Ex-Im to this summer’s fast-track trade bill and other spending measures before finally succeeding with the federal highway bill that landed on the President’s desk today.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“After months of pointless and harmful delays, reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank has received final approval from a bipartisan congressional majority,” National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said of the bill’s passage. “This is a victory for manufacturers of all sizes as well as for workers here in the United States.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Opponents of Ex-Im have meanwhile pledged to finish off Ex-Im when they next get a chance in four years. Marc Short, president of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners, told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that by elevating the Ex-Im issue to the national level, conservatives have put the “final nails in the coffin of Ex-Im” and will complete the coup de grâce in 2019.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), a vocal opponent of Ex-Im and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, similarly put companies backing Ex-Im on notice in a statement Wednesday. &#8220;I know if I was the CEO of a <em>Fortune</em> 50 corporation, I would think twice before building my long-term business plan on Ex-Im,” he said.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more on Boeing, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video:</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"32\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4318576056001-32\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4318576056001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1PFnNBl\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dboeing%2Cboeingceo%2Cboeingceosuccession%2Cboeingnews%2Cboeingsuccession%2Cbusinessnews%2Cdennismuilenburg%2Cdennismuilenburgceo%2Cnewboeingceo%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dboeing&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

              "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Airbus has</span><span class=\"s1\"> sold more than 1,000 aircraft in the first 11 months of this year, making the European aerospace giant more or less a lock to win its annual order competition with rival Boeing </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“BA”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ba/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“BA”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span></span><span class=\"s1\">. But with deliveries lagging, Airbus will almost certainly fail to meet its production targets for 2015, letting Boeing hold onto the “world’s largest plane maker” crown.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In terms of aircraft orders, Airbus outsold Boeing 1,007 to 568, excluding cancellations. Boeing, meanwhile, out-delivered Airbus by a wide margin, with 709 aircraft delivered over the same period. Airbus handed over the keys to just 556 aircraft in the first 11 months of the year, leaving it 74 aircraft short of its 2015 production target.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Given that Airbus is averaging 50 aircraft per month in 2015, it would have to lift production rates by roughly 50% to hit its end-of year target. Meanwhile Boeing is on target to produce the 750 to 755 aircraft it set out deliver this year, though it has some work to do if the company is going to fulfill its goal of selling as many aircraft as it produces in 2015.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the lopsided order book suggests Airbus is trouncing Boeing sales, a deeper reading of the numbers tells a more nuanced story, says Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at aerospace consultancy Teal Group.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Boeing’s actually a little bit ahead,” he says. “The idea of looking at any one year—it’s fun for bragging rights but otherwise it’s completely meaningless when </span><span class=\"s1\">you’ve got an industry with 12,000 jets on backlog</span><span class=\"s1\">. What you’ve got is a situation where Airbus is a little ahead in number of tails, but Boeing is slightly ahead in value. Airbus has a better position in the narrow-body market, Boeing is ahead in wide-body, and together it works out to be about 50-50.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Airbus has enjoyed strong sales over the last several years, particularly for the latest iteration of its popular A320 narrow-body jet&#8211;the A320neo&#8211;which will begin commercial operation next month. But the company has had trouble keeping pace on the production side. Deliveries of its wide-body A350 lag 2015 projections, with just 11 of the jets delivered so far in 2015 (four short of the company’s target). Airbus plans to deliver 30 A350s in 2016 even as Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier has acknowledged that suppliers are already having trouble coping with</span><span class=\"s1\"> Airbus’s increased rate of production on the A350 line.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That could spell trouble for the company going into 2016, though there’s plenty of good news for Airbus in the latest batch of industry numbers. Airbus’s strong position relative to Boeing in the narrow-body jetliner market persists. As Boeing hosted media at its Everett, Wash., manufacturing facility on Monday and Tuesday for a public unveiling of its new 737MAX narrow-body airliner, numbers released by Airbus showed that it has grabbed 60% of the market for fuel-efficient, smaller-body jets. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That market segment that continues to boom thanks to demand for short-haul air travel routes in Asia and elsewhere. And with Boeing&#8217;s 737MAX slated to enter service no sooner than 2017, Airbus has time to press its advantage. Boeing has sold just 292 jets in the 737MAX family thus far this year, compared with 781 in the same period last year. Airbus logged 825 orders for the A320neo, up from 782 the year before. All said, Airbus has 4,443 A320neos, while Boeing has just shy of 3,000 737MAX jets on order.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether or not Airbus can retain that market advantage will depend on several factors, not least each company’s ability to execute its aggressive manufacturing programs. Both Airbus and Boeing are pushing manufacturing rates skyward as orders continue to swell. But from an investor standpoint, Aboulafia says, the factors that could have the biggest impact on the industry are completely out of their CEOs’ hands: fuel prices and interest rates. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If oil prices remain low and the cost of borrowing inches upward, the industry could quickly find itself in trouble, he says. When fuel is costly and cash is cheap, it makes a lot of sense for airlines to look at replacing older, less efficient airplanes with newer, more efficient models. But if the environment changes, airlines may be less likely to buy new planes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“We’ve been living in this incredibly perfect environment for seven or eight years now where cash is almost free and there’s every reason in the world to replace your older aircraft,&#8221; Aboulafia says. &#8220;One of those is changing and the other one could well change.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more about Airbus, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4427044899001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4427044899001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1SMEB77\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/international_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daerodynamicimprovements%2Cairbus%2Cairbusa320neo%2Cairlineraddsplanes%2Cbloomberg%2Cdomesticairline%2Cgrowingaviationmarket%2Cindia%2Cindiaairtravel%2Cindianairtravel%2Cindiangovernmentapprovesplaneaddition%2Cindigo%2Cindigoaddstoairfleet%2Cindigoairbusdeal%2Cindigobudgettravel%2Clessfuel%26ch%3Dinternational%26topic%3Dindigo&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

              "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Congress has revived the dormant Export-Import Bank following a five-month hiatus as part of its passage of a $305 billion federal highway bill on Thursday. The federal agency, commonly known as the “Ex-Im” bank, ceased operation in June after lawmakers allowed its authorization to expire.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Supporters of the bank managed to tuck a provision extending the bank’s authorization through September 2019 into the must-pass transportation spending bill (without it, federal highway funding would have run out today). President Obama is expected to sign the bill today, reviving Ex-Im and boosting the fortunes of companies like Boeing </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“BA”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ba/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“BA”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span></span><span class=\"s1\">, General Electric </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“GE”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/ge/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“GE”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span></span><span class=\"s1\">, and Caterpillar </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"“CAT”\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/cat/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">“CAT”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> </span><span class=\"s1\">that rely on the bank’s federal loan guarantees for foreign buyers of U.S. goods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boeing and General Electric, in particular, took center-stage in the lobbying battle waged on behalf of Ex-Im alongside the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Those industry groups insist Ex-Im is necessary to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. firms in the global marketplace since most of their overseas competitors benefit from the same kind of government help.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“In recent weeks, we’ve seen how American companies are forced to operate at a unique disadvantage in global markets without Ex-Im, resulting in lost sales and lost jobs,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donahue said in a statement following the House’s passage of the bill. “We applaud the determined work of those Congressional leaders who have acted to protect the competitiveness of American companies.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, Congressional conservatives that oppose Ex-Im have vowed to continue the fight against what they view as corporate welfare.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Export-Import Bank is an executive branch agency that provides the financing tools—typically in the form of loan guarantees—to foreign governments and companies interested in purchasing American goods. While the bank provides financial backing for purchases of all kinds of manufactured products, it tends to favor the makers of large, capital equipment. As such, companies that sell things like commercial airliners, jet engines, construction equipment, and electrical grid infrastructure benefit disproportionately from Ex-Im’s loan guarantees.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boeing is by far the biggest beneficiary of Ex-Im financing, with 14% of its 2014 orders backstopped by the agency. Likewise, General Electric and construction equipment maker Caterpillar have a stake in Ex-Im’s continued existence. Between them, the three companies account for the majority of the bank’s financing, which totaled more than $20 billion last year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That’s led a bloc of conservative lawmakers as well influential groups including Freedom Partners (backed by the billionaire Koch brothers) and the conservative Heritage Foundation to label Ex-Im corporate welfare that benefits a few specific companies more than it benefits taxpayers. As Republican presidential candidates aligned against the bank earlier this year, Tea Party conservatives in Congress maneuvered to keep Ex-Im’s renewal off the House and Senate floors even though the majority of lawmakers continued to support it. When Ex-Im&#8217;s authorization came up for renewal in June, Congress failed to act and Ex-Im’s charter expired at the end of the month.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the months since, Boeing and GE have mounted an <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/25/boeing-export-import-bank/\">intense lobbying campaign</a> for Ex-Im’s renewal and pulled Super PAC donations and other financial contributions to lawmakers that oppose the bank. The bank’s allies tried to attach a provision renewing Ex-Im to this summer’s fast-track trade bill and other spending measures before finally succeeding with the federal highway bill that landed on the President’s desk today.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“After months of pointless and harmful delays, reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank has received final approval from a bipartisan congressional majority,” National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said of the bill’s passage. “This is a victory for manufacturers of all sizes as well as for workers here in the United States.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Opponents of Ex-Im have meanwhile pledged to finish off Ex-Im when they next get a chance in four years. Marc Short, president of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners, told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that by elevating the Ex-Im issue to the national level, conservatives have put the “final nails in the coffin of Ex-Im” and will complete the coup de grâce in 2019.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), a vocal opponent of Ex-Im and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, similarly put companies backing Ex-Im on notice in a statement Wednesday. &#8220;I know if I was the CEO of a <em>Fortune</em> 50 corporation, I would think twice before building my long-term business plan on Ex-Im,” he said.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more on Boeing, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video:</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"9\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4318576056001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4318576056001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1PFnNBl\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dboeing%2Cboeingceo%2Cboeingceosuccession%2Cboeingnews%2Cboeingsuccession%2Cbusinessnews%2Cdennismuilenburg%2Cdennismuilenburgceo%2Cnewboeingceo%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dboeing&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

      "content": "<p><em><em><i><em><span class=\"s1\"><em>The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “<span class=\"s1\">When making a tough business decision, how do you know when to trust your gut?</span>” is written by <i>Randy Rayess, cofounder of VenturePact. </i></em></span></em></i></em></em></p>\n<p>The key for any startup founder is to know which decisions to make and which decisions to delegate. If you end up making every decision, you’ll be overwhelmed with micromanaging when you should instead be focused on empowering the team to make their own decisions.</p>\n<p>Any new innovative technology will have uncertainty, which is why standard return on investment or net present value calculations won’t work as well. It’s these cases where you’ll have to trust your gut and resist overanalyzing and delaying the tough decisions.</p>\n<p>What I’ve found is that it’s always easier to delay the tough decisions and tackle the simpler problems first. But fearing making a mistake is much worse than trying something new and failing.</p>\n<p>At VenturePact, we’ve focused on building a culture of experimentation, where everyone is incentivized to experiment and search for new ideas and ways to improve. To make sure there is some control, we set deadlines and objectives to assess how the experiment is running. We know that many experiments will fail and will need to be shut down, but this is the best way to find the ones that work.</p>\n<p><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/12/entrepreneurs-success-decision/\" target=\"_blank\">This is How Long it Should Take to Make a Decision</a></em></p>\n<p>One key gut decision we had to make was deciding who would lead our product team. Hiring an executive is a critical decision and has a big impact on any company’s performance and culture. Some companies try to create algorithms based on a variety of resume factors to predict performance, but given the importance of cultural fit, we decided to go with our gut for all hiring decisions. We look for people who we think can embrace our culture of experimentation and who align well with our core values.</p>\n<p>Who to hire, promote, and fire are just some examples of tough gut decisions you’ll have to make on a regular basis to ensure you have the right team in place. Ultimately, we have experimented with our hiring process to see whether or not our instincts are good at identifying the right people. My team and I have found that informal settings such as a dinner or a lunch with a candidate prior to hiring helps us get a better feel for cultural fit.</p>\n<p>Having a great discipline around experimentation makes you a lot more comfortable handling tough decisions and going with your gut, as it creates a more agile business and allows your entire team to improve.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Randy Rayess is a Wharton/Penn undergraduate alumnus and cofounder </i><em>at <span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"http://venturepact.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VenturePact</a>, </span></em><i>a resource for on-demand vetted engineering teams. </i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"33\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4641028909001-33\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4641028909001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RqV0Re\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/mpw_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalyssamilano%2Cmostpowerfulwomen%2Cmpw%26ch%3Dmpw%26topic%3Dmostpowerfulwomen&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Read all responses to the Entrepreneur Insider question: <em><span class=\"s1\">When making a tough business decision, how do you know when to trust your gut?</span></em></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/12/entrepreneur-firing-employee/\" target=\"_blank\">Why You Shouldn’t Think Twice About Firing an Employee</a> </em>by <em>William Vanderbloemen, founder and CEO of Vanderbloemen Search Group.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/09/successful-leaders-tough-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\">This is How the Most Successful Leaders Make Tough Decisions</a> </em>by <span class=\"s1\">Simon Berg, CEO of Ceros.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/08/entrepreneur-fast-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Way to Make Fast Decisions</a> </em>by Vijay Ramani, cofounder and CEO of Totspot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/07/alfred-p-sloan-decision-making/\" target=\"_blank\">What Every Leader Can Learn From Alfred P.

They </span><span class=\"s2\">often</span><span class=\"s1\"> see them as failures or negatives, which </span><span class=\"s2\">can ruin </span><span class=\"s1\">their excitement. </span><span class=\"s2\">There are two </span><span class=\"s1\">valuable lessons </span><span class=\"s2\">I wish I would’ve learned before starting Bay Dynamics: W</span><span class=\"s1\">hat appear to be failures or negatives are actually positives</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and optimism is a key component </span><span class=\"s2\">to </span><span class=\"s1\">a</span><span class=\"s2\">ny</span><span class=\"s1\"> business leader’s success.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When building a company, </span><span class=\"s2\">you </span><span class=\"s1\">must be prepared for the </span><span class=\"s2\">crazy </span><span class=\"s1\">ride and realize that each up and down </span><span class=\"s2\">you experience will</span><span class=\"s1\"> lead to a success. </span><span class=\"s2\">L</span><span class=\"s1\">atch</span><span class=\"s2\">ing</span><span class=\"s1\"> onto that way of thinking will get </span><span class=\"s2\">you </span><span class=\"s1\">through the tougher times and give </span><span class=\"s2\">you </span><span class=\"s1\">more clarity into how </span><span class=\"s2\">you can</span><span class=\"s1\"> transform a seemingly negative event into a success beyond what </span><span class=\"s2\">you originally</span><span class=\"s1\"> envisioned. I can think of a number of examples where I encountered an event that, at the time, I thought was negative</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> but when looking back and rescoring that event based on the current state of our company, I realized it was for the greater good. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, </span><span class=\"s2\">whenever I would meet </span><span class=\"s1\">candidates who I thought were a perfect fit for our team</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> I</span><span class=\"s2\">’d</span><span class=\"s1\"> chase them relentlessly</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> trying to remove all </span><span class=\"s2\">of </span><span class=\"s1\">the obstacles that could steer them away</span><span class=\"s2\">.</span> <span class=\"s2\">But</span><span class=\"s1\"> just a few months after they </span><span class=\"s2\">would join the team</span><span class=\"s1\">, </span><span class=\"s2\">both sides would </span><span class=\"s1\">realize it wasn’t working out. </span><span class=\"s2\">I used to </span><span class=\"s1\">score it as a failure</span><span class=\"s2\">—</span><span class=\"s1\">I spent all of that time chasing one candidate who</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> in the end, wasn’t the right fit. </span><span class=\"s2\">But now I realize that </span><span class=\"s1\">when those candidates left, it opened the door for the right candidate to </span><span class=\"s2\">step in, </span><span class=\"s1\">and in the end, I had an employee who exceeded my expectations and helped us achieve things I never would&#8217;ve imagined.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/15/virtual-offices-dont-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Why Virtual Offices Don’t Work</a></em></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I learned from those experiences and now have a better understanding of what to look for when interviewing potential employees. I</span><span class=\"s2\">f you have</span><span class=\"s1\"> to tirelessly chase a candidate</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> then </span><span class=\"s2\">he or she</span><span class=\"s1\"> most likely </span><span class=\"s2\">isn’t</span><span class=\"s1\"> the right fit. </span><span class=\"s2\">S</span><span class=\"s1\">eemingly negative hiring experiences </span><span class=\"s2\">can </span><span class=\"s1\">produce</span><span class=\"s1\"> positive outcomes on </span><span class=\"s2\">a few </span><span class=\"s1\">fronts</span><span class=\"s2\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">You’ll </span><span class=\"s1\">end up with even better employees</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> save time</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and miss fewer opportunities to hire the right people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As Winston Churchill said, </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">I am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else.</span><span class=\"s2\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">If </span><span class=\"s2\">you’re</span><span class=\"s1\"> in a bad mood or </span><span class=\"s2\">distracted by</span><span class=\"s1\"> personal issue</span><span class=\"s2\">s</span><span class=\"s1\">, strive to not project the problem externally. If you project negativity, the rest of your team will feel it</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> too</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and everyone will be less productive</span><span class=\"s2\">. T</span><span class=\"s1\">ry to be enthusiastic and optimistic </span><span class=\"s2\">when talking to team members.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A company is really a group of people coming together and working toward</span><span class=\"s1\"> a common goal. Your people are the bricks of your company</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and they need </span><span class=\"s2\">a </span><span class=\"s1\">consistently strong mortar (you) to hold them together. They watch how you approach situations, whether they are negative or positive, and follow your lead. As a leader, if you exhibit feelings of distress, anger</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> or frustration, your team will pick up on those feelings and reflect that same negativity. </span><span class=\"s2\">But i</span><span class=\"s1\">f you approach situations confidently and optimistically, so will your team</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and they&#8217;ll perform</span><span class=\"s2\"> at their best</span><span class=\"s1\"> in the end.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"34\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4641028909001-34\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4641028909001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RpehCD\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/mpw_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalyssamilano%2Cmostpowerfulwomen%2Cmpw%26ch%3Dmpw%26topic%3Dmostpowerfulwomen&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Read all responses to the Entrepreneur Insider question: What’s something you wish you knew before starting your business?</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/13/entrepreneur-quality-success/\" target=\"_blank\">The One Quality That Defines a Great Entrepreneur</a> </em>by Anthony Katz, founder of Hyperice.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/01/apple-entrepreneur-success-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">What Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From Apple</a> </em>by Michael Maven, founder of Carter &amp; Kingsley.</p>\n",

          "content": "<p><em>The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “What’s something you wish you knew before starting your business?” is written by <em>William Vanderbloemen, founder and CEO of Vanderbloemen Search Group.</em></em></p>\n<p>When I told my friends and family that I was leaving my corporate job to start my own business in the middle of the 2008 recession, many of them told me I might be crazy. When I told them my business was going to help churches find their staffs, they told me I was definitely crazy.</p>\n<p>Almost six years later, with quarter-over-quarter growth and a team of 32 full-time staff members, it <em>has</em> been crazy. But it’s also been the best decision I ever made.</p>\n<p>I’ve learned a lot in the last six years. Here are a few things I now know that would have been helpful when I was starting my business:</p>\n<p><strong>Slow and steady wins the race</strong><br />\nIn my early years, I thought that rapid growth resulted in long-term success. In the last few years, I‘ve learned that rapid growth is <em>not</em> the secret to long-term success—repeated growth is. Rather than striving for rapid growth, having this mindset allows entrepreneurs to focus on scalability and long-term strategy instead of reactionary tactics that might get them off track.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t get distracted by shiny objects</strong><br />\nEntrepreneurs are notorious for letting their opportunistic outlook distract them from their core offering. I call it SOS—Shiny Object Syndrome. It can be both a gift and a curse. It’s fun and exciting to run in different directions and explore the next big thing, but chasing after ideas that you can’t trace back to your core service offering can be detrimental to your business.</p>\n<p><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/13/entrepreneur-quality-success/\" target=\"_blank\">The One Quality That Defines a Great Entrepreneur</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Virtual offices just don’t work</strong><br />\nWhen I started our business, I thought we could save on overhead by having everyone work from home and call in for meetings. Virtual was the thing to do at the time. We tried it for a while, but I began realizing we were missing opportunities for collaboration. If I wanted to help more churches, I needed to bring the team under one roof. Choosing to have an in-house team has revolutionized the quality of our work. The ability to quickly collaborate as a group or huddle into small teams to solve problems has allowed us to be agile and serve our clients better than ever. Virtual is overrated, and in-house is unparalleled.</p>\n<p><strong>Culture is king</strong><br />\nA mantra I’ve picked up in the last six years is, “Culture trumps competency every time.” One of my first hires was an ivy-league graduate with a killer resume but a toxic work ethic. I quickly realized that I had hired for competency instead of culture. Since then, our team has worked tirelessly to build a contagious culture, and we were ranked No. 1 best small business culture by <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/252279\" target=\"_blank\">Entreprenuer.com</a> this year. We established nine values that permeate every aspect of our team, and it’s been a game changer for recruiting and retaining high-capacity people. Our team is passionate about what we do and loves working together.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the many lessons I’ve learned over the last six years. I hope they encourage you as you build your business. It’s been a fun journey, and I’m anticipating great things ahead.</p>\n<p><em>Read all responses to the Entrepreneur Insider question: What’s something you wish you knew before starting your business?</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/01/apple-entrepreneur-success-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">What Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From Apple</a> </em>by Michael Maven, founder of Carter &amp; Kingsley.</p>\n",

          "content": "<p><em>The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “How do you run a startup with a full-time job?” is written by <em>Neil Powell, cofounder of </em><em>Mugnacious.</em></em></p>\n<p>“Find a job you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.” That’s the evergreen, simplistic, and existential answer to the question—balancing a full-time job with a startup you’ve always dreamed of running.</p>\n<p>The not-so-simplistic and more realistic scenario? Finding a hobby you can profit off of, live off of, and one that can support your family. It’s about finding a line of work that gives you that “fire” in your belly, the passion project you dream about that will turn you into the next Elon Musk, who most certainly has a demanding professional life. Yet, Musk also spends his spare time running the spaceflight company SpaceX, evident that the balance is possible if you truly enjoy what you’re doing.</p>\n<p>Here are a few lessons I recently learned (many the hard way) while working full-time as an artist and starting a company:</p>\n<p><strong>You can turn even the most ‘pathetic’ of hobbies into a successful line of business </strong><br />\nI learned there’s a need for nearly everything in the world, no matter how pervasive or cliché it may seem. My own startup, which launched earlier this year, comes from a hobby I didn’t even <em>realize </em>was a hobby. Living in New York City for the last 20-plus years, it’s a given that no matter where I am, or what time of day it is, I’m surrounded by a diverse mix of personalities, whether I’m on the subway, at a bar, or at the gym. While most New Yorkers are glued to their phones with ear buds firmly plugged in, I pass my time observing and taking notes in my faithful sketchpad of the absurd conversations and interactions of people around me.</p>\n<p>Never did I imagine that the things I idly jotted down in my sketchpad would become profitable until a close friend (who is now my business partner) convinced me to turn the sayings I’ve jotted over the years into an artistic, physical platform. And hey, why not into coffee mugs? People are grumpy in the morning, and when was the last time you saw a coffee mug that brought a chuckle to the most mundane time of day? My business partner and I saw the value of tapping into the coffee mug market. It sounds ridiculous, but despite the ubiquity of coffee mugs, the market is bland. So, why not change that? Whether it’s a personal need or a need in the market, understanding what you’re building is absolutely key.</p>\n<p><strong>There is no such thing as overnight success</strong><br />\nAfter months and months of gearing up for the inauguration of our new company, we finally launched in August. We’re up and running, but how do we attract customers? We’ve learned that just because you build it doesn’t mean they will come. No matter how innovative your business may be, it’s important to understand the virtue of patience. Startups are incredibly risky, time-consuming, and often daunting. When you are splitting your days between your day job and your side venture, achieving success with the latter of the two can take twice as long. Be prepared to make slow progress, as opposed to turning profits and seeing business boom right away.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare for the challenges and difficult moments</strong><br />\nIn the bleak and dark days, when you have zero free time and can’t remember the last time you slept more than four hours, it helps to remember what a privilege it is to be creating a business based on your ideals and your creative vision. We all want overnight success. We live in a world of instant gratification. The media sheds light on people who have seemingly obtained it all overnight. That is a fallacy. Here’s a bit of brutal reality: There is no silver bullet. Having instant market success is like winning the lottery. Ever bought a ticket? It’s fun to dream about, but it’s not reality.</p>\n<p>As the late and great Winston Churchill once said, “Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.neilpowell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Powell</a> is the cofounder of </em><a href=\"http://mugnacious.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mugnacious</em></a><em>; an award-winning product designer and a fine artist whose work is in the permanent collection of The Smithsonian Institution’s Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum.</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"35\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4644431446001-35\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4644431446001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P51vpq\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/energy_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbusinessnews%2Celonmusk%2Celonmuskcarbontax%2Celonmusknews%2Celonmuskpantheonsorbonneuniversity%2Celonmuskparis%2Celonmusktesla%2Ctechnews%2Cworldnews%26ch%3Denergy%26topic%3Delonmusk&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

I</span><span class=\"s2\">f you have</span><span class=\"s1\"> to tirelessly chase a candidate</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> then </span><span class=\"s2\">he or she</span><span class=\"s1\"> most likely </span><span class=\"s2\">isn’t</span><span class=\"s1\"> the right fit. </span><span class=\"s2\">S</span><span class=\"s1\">eemingly negative hiring experiences </span><span class=\"s2\">can </span><span class=\"s1\">produce</span><span class=\"s1\"> positive outcomes on </span><span class=\"s2\">a few </span><span class=\"s1\">fronts</span><span class=\"s2\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">You’ll </span><span class=\"s1\">end up with even better employees</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> save time</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and miss fewer opportunities to hire the right people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As Winston Churchill said, </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">I am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else.</span><span class=\"s2\">” </span><span class=\"s1\">If </span><span class=\"s2\">you’re</span><span class=\"s1\"> in a bad mood or </span><span class=\"s2\">distracted by</span><span class=\"s1\"> personal issue</span><span class=\"s2\">s</span><span class=\"s1\">, strive to not project the problem externally. If you project negativity, the rest of your team will feel it</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> too</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and everyone will be less productive</span><span class=\"s2\">.

              "content": "<p><em>The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “What’s something you wish you knew before starting your business?” is written by <em>William Vanderbloemen, founder and CEO of Vanderbloemen Search Group.</em></em></p>\n<p>When I told my friends and family that I was leaving my corporate job to start my own business in the middle of the 2008 recession, many of them told me I might be crazy. When I told them my business was going to help churches find their staffs, they told me I was definitely crazy.</p>\n<p>Almost six years later, with quarter-over-quarter growth and a team of 32 full-time staff members, it <em>has</em> been crazy. But it’s also been the best decision I ever made.</p>\n<p>I’ve learned a lot in the last six years. Here are a few things I now know that would have been helpful when I was starting my business:</p>\n<p><strong>Slow and steady wins the race</strong><br />\nIn my early years, I thought that rapid growth resulted in long-term success. In the last few years, I‘ve learned that rapid growth is <em>not</em> the secret to long-term success—repeated growth is. Rather than striving for rapid growth, having this mindset allows entrepreneurs to focus on scalability and long-term strategy instead of reactionary tactics that might get them off track.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t get distracted by shiny objects</strong><br />\nEntrepreneurs are notorious for letting their opportunistic outlook distract them from their core offering. I call it SOS—Shiny Object Syndrome. It can be both a gift and a curse. It’s fun and exciting to run in different directions and explore the next big thing, but chasing after ideas that you can’t trace back to your core service offering can be detrimental to your business.</p>\n<p><em>See also: <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/13/entrepreneur-quality-success/\" target=\"_blank\">The One Quality That Defines a Great Entrepreneur</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Virtual offices just don’t work</strong><br />\nWhen I started our business, I thought we could save on overhead by having everyone work from home and call in for meetings. Virtual was the thing to do at the time. We tried it for a while, but I began realizing we were missing opportunities for collaboration. If I wanted to help more churches, I needed to bring the team under one roof. Choosing to have an in-house team has revolutionized the quality of our work. The ability to quickly collaborate as a group or huddle into small teams to solve problems has allowed us to be agile and serve our clients better than ever. Virtual is overrated, and in-house is unparalleled.</p>\n<p><strong>Culture is king</strong><br />\nA mantra I’ve picked up in the last six years is, “Culture trumps competency every time.” One of my first hires was an ivy-league graduate with a killer resume but a toxic work ethic. I quickly realized that I had hired for competency instead of culture. Since then, our team has worked tirelessly to build a contagious culture, and we were ranked No. 1 best small business culture by <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/252279\" target=\"_blank\">Entreprenuer.com</a> this year. We established nine values that permeate every aspect of our team, and it’s been a game changer for recruiting and retaining high-capacity people. Our team is passionate about what we do and loves working together.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the many lessons I’ve learned over the last six years. I hope they encourage you as you build your business. It’s been a fun journey, and I’m anticipating great things ahead.</p>\n<p><em>Read all responses to the Entrepreneur Insider question: What’s something you wish you knew before starting your business?</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/01/apple-entrepreneur-success-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">What Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From Apple</a> </em>by Michael Maven, founder of Carter &amp; Kingsley.</p>\n",

              "content": "<p><em>The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “How do you run a startup with a full-time job?” is written by <em>Neil Powell, cofounder of </em><em>Mugnacious.</em></em></p>\n<p>“Find a job you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.” That’s the evergreen, simplistic, and existential answer to the question—balancing a full-time job with a startup you’ve always dreamed of running.</p>\n<p>The not-so-simplistic and more realistic scenario? Finding a hobby you can profit off of, live off of, and one that can support your family. It’s about finding a line of work that gives you that “fire” in your belly, the passion project you dream about that will turn you into the next Elon Musk, who most certainly has a demanding professional life. Yet, Musk also spends his spare time running the spaceflight company SpaceX, evident that the balance is possible if you truly enjoy what you’re doing.</p>\n<p>Here are a few lessons I recently learned (many the hard way) while working full-time as an artist and starting a company:</p>\n<p><strong>You can turn even the most ‘pathetic’ of hobbies into a successful line of business </strong><br />\nI learned there’s a need for nearly everything in the world, no matter how pervasive or cliché it may seem. My own startup, which launched earlier this year, comes from a hobby I didn’t even <em>realize </em>was a hobby. Living in New York City for the last 20-plus years, it’s a given that no matter where I am, or what time of day it is, I’m surrounded by a diverse mix of personalities, whether I’m on the subway, at a bar, or at the gym. While most New Yorkers are glued to their phones with ear buds firmly plugged in, I pass my time observing and taking notes in my faithful sketchpad of the absurd conversations and interactions of people around me.</p>\n<p>Never did I imagine that the things I idly jotted down in my sketchpad would become profitable until a close friend (who is now my business partner) convinced me to turn the sayings I’ve jotted over the years into an artistic, physical platform. And hey, why not into coffee mugs? People are grumpy in the morning, and when was the last time you saw a coffee mug that brought a chuckle to the most mundane time of day? My business partner and I saw the value of tapping into the coffee mug market. It sounds ridiculous, but despite the ubiquity of coffee mugs, the market is bland. So, why not change that? Whether it’s a personal need or a need in the market, understanding what you’re building is absolutely key.</p>\n<p><strong>There is no such thing as overnight success</strong><br />\nAfter months and months of gearing up for the inauguration of our new company, we finally launched in August. We’re up and running, but how do we attract customers? We’ve learned that just because you build it doesn’t mean they will come. No matter how innovative your business may be, it’s important to understand the virtue of patience. Startups are incredibly risky, time-consuming, and often daunting. When you are splitting your days between your day job and your side venture, achieving success with the latter of the two can take twice as long. Be prepared to make slow progress, as opposed to turning profits and seeing business boom right away.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare for the challenges and difficult moments</strong><br />\nIn the bleak and dark days, when you have zero free time and can’t remember the last time you slept more than four hours, it helps to remember what a privilege it is to be creating a business based on your ideals and your creative vision. We all want overnight success. We live in a world of instant gratification. The media sheds light on people who have seemingly obtained it all overnight. That is a fallacy. Here’s a bit of brutal reality: There is no silver bullet. Having instant market success is like winning the lottery. Ever bought a ticket? It’s fun to dream about, but it’s not reality.</p>\n<p>As the late and great Winston Churchill once said, “Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.neilpowell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Powell</a> is the cofounder of </em><a href=\"http://mugnacious.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mugnacious</em></a><em>; an award-winning product designer and a fine artist whose work is in the permanent collection of The Smithsonian Institution’s Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum.</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"5\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4644431446001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4644431446001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1P51vpq\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/energy_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbusinessnews%2Celonmusk%2Celonmuskcarbontax%2Celonmusknews%2Celonmuskpantheonsorbonneuniversity%2Celonmuskparis%2Celonmusktesla%2Ctechnews%2Cworldnews%26ch%3Denergy%26topic%3Delonmusk&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

      "title": "Robert De Niro's New Luxury Hotel Named World's Worst",
      "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> In a partnership that seemed destined for greatness, Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro joined forces with Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.noburestaurants.com/footer/cast/nobu-matsuhisa/#.VnK3lHo8KrV\">chef Matsuhisa Nobu </a><span class=\"s2\">to open Nobu Hotel Manila</span>, an opulent new property in the Philippines. However, the slam-dunk of a project has just hit a major problem: The Nobu Hotel was just named 2015&#8217;s worst new luxury hotel.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The review comes from from Luxury Travel Intelligence, a members-only high-end travel-rating company. Luxury Travel, a partner of Etihad Airlines, has its reviewers travel anonymously and pay full rates so as to encourage non-biased reporting on hotels, restaurants, spas, and nightlife. &#8220;Nobu Hotel Manila was a great disappointment,&#8221; the company&#8217;s co-founder, Michael Crompton, tells <span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://fortune.com/\">Fortune.com</a>, adding that Luxury Travel also received &#8220;negative feedback&#8221; on the hotel from some of its members. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For a luxury hotel, the Nobu Hotel Manila is relatively large, with 321 rooms. And Crompton says, &#8220;while the accommodations are, in the main, impressive, it seems to be suffering from poor management.&#8221; He also said that luxury travelers expect and desire &#8220;to experience something special&#8221; and this hotel doesn&#8217;t deliver it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although he notes that Nobu restaurants have been well reviewed by his company and others, he says, &#8220;We worry that the Nobu brand maybe overextending itself. </span><span class=\"s1\">The move into hotels is questionable, particularly when they are large properties with hundreds of rooms. Nobu has always been about exclusivity and luxury. Now, new Nobu restaurants tend to be much larger operations and the hotels, so far, seem so far removed from exclusive.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When reached by <a href=\"http://fortune.com/\"><span class=\"s2\">Fortune.com</span></a>, a publicist for the Nobu property declined to comment on the low rating.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rooms at the five-star property start at $164 for a regular deluxe room and $400 for a Nobu Suite with city views.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Professional travel photographer Guillaume de Vaudrey, who splits his time between Paris and Manila, does not find the Nobu Hotel&#8217;s low rating at all surprising, saying, &#8220;It is fine for leisure travelers who are fans of casinos. However, it is not at all appropriate for business-minded travelers or high-ranking VIPs who have much better options when in Manila.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312693-d7318728-Reviews-Nobu_Hotel_Manila-Paranaque_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html\">On TripAdvisor</a>, which contains travelers&#8217; reviews, Nobu Hotel Manila was ranked the fourth best out of 13 hotels in Manila. Some of the less-than-stellar reviews complained about rude service. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The <a href=\"http://The first Nobu Hotel opened within Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas in 2013 and was named one of the hottest new hotels by CNN Travel. Nobu Hotel Manila is Nobu Hospitality's first hotel in Asia. It is also expected to open luxury hotels soon in Chicago, Miami, Bahrain, Riyadh, London and Los Cabos in Mexico. - See more at: http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/489302/lifestyle/the-wait-is-over-robert-de-niro-chef-nobu-open-luxury-hotel-in-manila#sthash.9SrtiJnL.dpuf\">first Nobu Hotel opened within Caesar&#8217;s Palace in Las Vegas </a>in 2103. CNN Travel dubbed it one of the hottest new hotels. The negative ratings from Luxury Travel Intelligence aren&#8217;t a good omen for the team behind the new Nobu Hotel; indeed, they are slated to open eight more luxury properties in the next two years. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Luxury Travel Intelligence&#8217;s Best New Luxury Hotels 2015</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1.

A few winning hotels offer round-the-clock butler service, and several winners employ concierges who belong to the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.lcdusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Les Clefs d’Or</a>. One winning hotel in London even boasts that its staffers outnumber guests by two to one. But readers also applauded hotels that offer intangible service: friendly staffers who seem authentically warm, rather than merely polite.</p>\n<p>Certainly, The Goring did more to win Gibson’s loyalty than just ply her with bubbly. After checking in, she realized she’d left a sweater at another hotel. She asked The Goring to give that property a heads-up that she would come to get it. “There was no need,” she says. “When I  got back after lunch, it was already hanging in my  closet.  I don’t think I&#8217;d stay anywhere else in London now. The Goring really won  my heart. ”</p>\n<h2>10. The Oberoi Rajvilas in Jaipur, India</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-10-oberoi-rajvilas.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351215\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-10-oberoi-rajvilas.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-10-oberoi-rajvilas\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Oberoi</span></p>\n<p>This opulent <a href=\"http://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-jaipur\" target=\"_blank\">resort</a> on the grounds of an 18<sup>th</sup>-century Shiva temple made readers swoon so much that they ranked it in Asia’s top 5 for romantic ambience. Adorned with gold-leaf frescoes and chandeliers, the resort could even spoil you for camping: Aside from its plush rooms and villas, the resort features several luxe tents, accented with block-printed fabrics, golden thread and post-maharaja-era A/C. And lest you think you could lose yourself in the 32 acres of resort grounds, you can always call reception, using one of the path-side phones, and request that a golf cart come fetch you. Even with its over-the-top vibes, the hotel ranked highly for good value.</p>\n<h2>9. Triple Creek Ranch in Darby, MT</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-9-triple-creek-ranch.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351214\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-9-triple-creek-ranch.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-9-triple-creek-ranch\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Triple Creek Inn</span></p>\n<p>This all-inclusive, dude-ranch-style <a href=\"http://www.triplecreekranch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">resort</a> in the Bitterroot Valley successfully lassoed the affections of readers, who liked that their itineraries were tailored nicely to their tastes—whether that meant wine tastings, fly fishing or escorted cattle drives. Readers applauded the friendly, above-and-beyond staffers, who pride themselves on overhearing your wishes, then granting them—like finding that pretty feather you saw on the trail; readers also liked the fabulous log cabins with stone fireplaces and high-end Western art. The hotel tied for third in the U.S. for its upscale take on ranch cuisine, like grilled Texas quail with bourbon sauce, or espresso mousse for dessert.</p>\n<h2>8. Inn at Palmetto Bluff, A Montage Resort in Bluffton, SC</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-8-inn-at-palmetto-bluff.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351213\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-8-inn-at-palmetto-bluff.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-8-inn-at-palmetto-bluff\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Tai Power Seef</span></p>\n<p>Comprised of <a href=\"http://www.montagehotels.com/palmettobluff/\" target=\"_blank\">50 porch-screened cottages</a>, surrounded by live oaks and Spanish moss, this resort ranked at No. 1 in the survey for families, perhaps because it’s the kind of place where you can happily stay put for the whole vacation. You get free use of bicycles during your stay, and the kids club offers such diversions as pirate treasure hunts, crabbing lessons or pointers from the resort’s golf instructors. Since the kids are occupied, the grown-ups have more freedom to play tennis, go horseback riding or just sit in a rocker—an activity called “porching” here—while being handed a glass of sweet tea. The resort is about to expand by 150 more rooms, but still ranked at No. 5 in the world for its quaint design.</p>\n<h2>7.

Once you’ve checked in, you can also ride, for free, one of the hotel’s four shuttle boats, which make nearly 650 trips a day to three area piers. The hotel made the survey’s top 5 for its executive-friendly rooms (all of which have views of the Chao Phraya River): they come with two international-direct-dial phones, your own fax number and a fresh bowl of fortifying fruit every day. For decompressing after your meetings, the hotel’s spa—featuring the signature Royal Thai massage, unlocking 10 pressure points—also ranked in the world’s top 10.</p>\n<h2>6. Egerton House Hotel in London</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-egerton-house-hotel.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351207\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-egerton-house-hotel.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-egerton-house-hotel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of The Red Carnation Hotel Collection</span></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://egertonhousehotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">28-room townhouse-turned-hotel</a> in Knightsbridge was praised by readers for feeling like a comfortably plush home—one run by friendly staffers who are known to arrange for a guest’s birthday cake without being asked. One staffer in particular was named repeatedly: Antonio the bartender, beloved for his disarming demeanor and world-class martinis. Even if you never venture into the hotel’s intimate bar, you’ll be greeted on arrival by a glass of bubbly or a cup of freshly brewed tea. Rooms are regularly re-stocked with fresh flowers and fruit, as well as nightly treats and an old-school hot water bottle.</p>\n<h2>5. Castello di Casole in Casole d&#8217;Elsa, Tuscany</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-castello-di-casole.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351206\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-castello-di-casole.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-castello-di-casole\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Castello di Casole</span></p>\n<p>Readers were exuberant about <a href=\"http://www.castellodicasole.com/activities\" target=\"_blank\">this hotel</a>, which was built around a 10<sup>th</sup> century castle on 4,200 acres, because they felt immediately connected to the Tuscan landscape: The hotel also won 1<sup>st</sup>-place ties in categories such as romance, design and cuisine. All rooms come with welcome bottles of estate-made extra virgin oil and <em>vino</em>, while the bilingual concierges can help set up dinner reservations, tours or cooking classes. Indeed, the “home cooking” at the hotel’s Ristorante Tosca may have been a big part of guests feeling connected, too, thanks to dishes like the spinach risotto with duck breast and raspberries, or house-made Sicilian pistachio spaghetti with wild boar from the hotel’s preserve.</p>\n<h2>4. The Inn at Little Washington in Washington, VA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-inn-at-little-washington.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351210\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-inn-at-little-washington.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-inn-at-little-washington\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Inn at Little Washington</span></p>\n<p>At first glance, <a href=\"http://www.theinnatlittlewashington.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this small property</a> in rural Virginia is primarily a foodie magnet, run by James Beard Award-winner Patrick O’Connell. But readers awarded it the first-place tie for service because they said they were treated as though there was just one room here, not 24. Housekeeping tidies up your room not once (or twice) but three times time a day, and your rate includes both breakfast and afternoon tea. One reader liked how his waiter, at breakfast, drew him a map of local produce stands worth visiting. The locally-sourced restaurant—with a menu emphasizing classic French cuisine and a 14,000-bottle wine cellar—also earned the Inn at Little Washington the No. 1 cuisine ranking among U.S hotels.</p>\n<h2>3. The Goring in London</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-goring-london.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351208\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-goring-london.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-goring-london\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of The Goring</span></p>\n<p>This is where Kate Middleton stayed before her royal wedding, and readers gush that they love this <a href=\"http://www.thegoring.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hotel</a> because the staff has a knack for learning your name quickly, and making anyone feel like a VIP. (The hotel’s head concierge belongs to Les Clefs d’Or, but merely goes by “Big John.”) If you stay in a suite, you’ll even get the automatic services of a footman, dressed in a scarlet tailcoat and a gold-trimmed vest. The 69-room, family-owned hotel also made the top 20 for its cuisine—an elegant take on English classics—and the Goring Dining Room won its first Michelin star this year. For brunch, try the lobster-accented Eggs Drumkilbo, once the favorite of the Queen Mum.</p>\n<h2>2. Hotel 41 in London</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-hotel-41-london.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351209\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-hotel-41-london.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-hotel-41-london\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of 41 London</span></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.41hotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">boutique hotel</a>’s tucked-away location—across from Buckingham Palace’s Royal Mews—gives it an air of exclusivity, but its staffer-to-guest ratio (2 to 1) really brings home the hotel’s commitment to service. The 41 also got raves from readers for keeping you well-fed: the rotating selection of complimentary tea and treats runs from breakfast time until 1 a.m. Despite the upscale environs, readers commented that the friendly service is never stuffy: One commented that the family’s cat enjoyed the pet-friendly property so much that even she didn’t want to leave. With its striking black-and-white rooms, the hotel also made the survey’s Europe top 10 for cool design.</p>\n<h2>1. The Oberoi Udaivilas in Udaipur, India</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-oberoi-udaivilas.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351211\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-oberoi-udaivilas.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-oberoi-udaivilas\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Oberoi</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-udaipur\" target=\"_blank\">This dome-topped resort</a> on the banks of Lake Pichola was once a royal hunting ground, and it tied for first place by still making guests feel like maharajas. Readers loved the private boat ride you take across the lake to arrive at the hotel (and for a fee, you can take a covered <em>shikara</em> back on the water at sundown, for canapés and stargazing). The hotel also tied for first in the survey for its rooms, which come with elegant dark woods and peacock-blue accents (to match the feathered creatures wandering outside), as well as a 24-hour, on-call butler. Given the views of the lake and city, the hotel also ranked at the top for its prime locale.</p>\n<p><em>This article was <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/the-worlds-best-hotel-service\" target=\"_blank\">previously published</a> on</em> Travel + Leisure. <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">T+L</a> <em>is a content partner of Fortune.com.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more on the hospitality industry, watch this Fortune video:</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"37\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3881422032001-37\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3881422032001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Z4Lo0I\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dchristophertkaczyk%2Cdisruptors%2Ctravelandleisure%26ch%3D%26topic%3Ddisruptors&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>More good reads from</strong> <em>T+L</em><strong>:</strong><br />\n• <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/new-york-comedy-festival\" target=\"_blank\">Get Your Tickets to the New York Comedy Festival</a><br />\n• <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/nanette-lepore-art-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Nanette Lepore’s New Art Gallery is in Her Living Room</a><br />\n• <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/new-york-city-ballet-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">The Newest Ballerinas on Instagram and Hemingway&#8217;s Michigan</a></p>\n",

          "content": "<p>Want to know what&#8217;s it&#8217;s like to drive a Tesla Model S sedan? It will only cost you $845 a night at the Mandarin Oriental Washington, D.C. to find out. The hotel is offering an &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.mandarinoriental.com/washington/hotel-offers/electrifying-getaway/\" target=\"_blank\">electrifying getaway</a>&#8221; promotion between September 8 and December 15, 2015. Check in for a maximum of two nights and, among such perks as a spa treatment, European breakfast, and cocktail and hors d&#8217;oeuvres reception, you have the use of a Tesla Model S for the duration of your stay.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s only one car available, so planning a booking in advance is a must, but this isn&#8217;t the first time Tesla and hotels have been linked at the marketing hip. Upscale properties like to dangle the allure of a high-profile ride, while the auto manufacturer gets exposure to high net-worth individuals who might be a candidate for one of their vehicles.</p>\n<p>For example, Tesla has held a test drive event at the <a href=\"my.teslamotors.com/event/experience-model-s-mandarin-oriental-miami\" target=\"_blank\">Mandarin Oriental Miami</a> in May. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mo_newyork/status/622072565792677888\" target=\"_blank\">Mandarin Oriental NY has a Tesla house car</a> that it welcomed on Twitter as its &#8220;newest addition.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re in <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/findus/location/charger/dc621\" target=\"_blank\">Atlanta and need to charge your Tesla</a>, you can stop by that city&#8217;s Mandarin Oriental for a free plug in.</p>\n<p>Other hotels have used the Tesla in promotions as well. The Ritz-Carlton Beijing at the end of May presented &#8220;Tesla Tea Time,&#8221; combining traditional English afternoon tea and a Model S test drive. Starting in February 2015, <a href=\"http://roadwarriorvoices.com/2015/02/14/virgin-hotels-chicago-officially-americas-coolest-hotel-will-now-drive-you-around-in-a-tesla/\" target=\"_blank\">Virgin Hotels Chicago had a $121,000 Tesla Model S P85D</a> &#8212; described by the hotel as the currently &#8220;hippest and highest performing electric car on the market&#8221; &#8212; for guest rides to &#8220;select areas in Chicago.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"38\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4387392672001-38\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4387392672001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1hMETP0\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/autos_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dtesla%2Cteslaadvertisingstrategies%2Cteslaincentiveprogram%2Cteslamodel3%2Cteslamodels%2Cteslamodelx%2Cteslamotors%2Cteslapreowned%2Cteslasales%2Cteslasalesstrategies%2Cteslaused%26ch%3Dautos%26topic%3Dtesla&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The continued marketing may be good to gain more attention and buyers. Or perhaps it&#8217;s also a way to keep people who have ordered a car to hanging on until they get theirs delivered. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/teslas-model-x-electric-suv-ship-september\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla Model X electric SUV is supposed to ship in September</a> &#8212; three years late &#8212; to the reported 20,000 people who already paid $5,000 each to pre-order.</p>\n<p>Riding Tesla coattails has become so popular that even less venerable establishments have hopped onto the bandwagon. The Victoria Part Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, which boasts &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-victoria-park.html#map_closed\" target=\"_blank\">cable TV, microwave, and small refrigerator</a>&#8221; in every room and suite, also notes that it has a Tesla charging station available.</p>\n<p>The ultimate close connection between the Tesla name and an overnight stay might have happened in January when a Phoenix, Arizona man tried <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/25/tesla-model-s-hotel-airbnb/\" target=\"_blank\">renting out his Tesla</a> on Airbnb for $85 a night. He offered an <a href=\"http://teslarenter.com/tesla-hotel/\" target=\"_blank\">8-inch air mattress</a> in the back of the car with the seats folded down. But he gave up, as it &#8220;really wasn&#8217;t practical.&#8221;</p>\n",

On-site character breakfasts spoil youngsters, while parents can indulge in the spa’s exclusive touch treatment with birchwood massage sticks and hot basalt stones. Our only qualm? There is no Four Seasons loyalty program with which devout guests can express their affection.</p>\n",

A few winning hotels offer round-the-clock butler service, and several winners employ concierges who belong to the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.lcdusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Les Clefs d’Or</a>. One winning hotel in London even boasts that its staffers outnumber guests by two to one. But readers also applauded hotels that offer intangible service: friendly staffers who seem authentically warm, rather than merely polite.</p>\n<p>Certainly, The Goring did more to win Gibson’s loyalty than just ply her with bubbly. After checking in, she realized she’d left a sweater at another hotel. She asked The Goring to give that property a heads-up that she would come to get it. “There was no need,” she says. “When I  got back after lunch, it was already hanging in my  closet.  I don’t think I&#8217;d stay anywhere else in London now. The Goring really won  my heart. ”</p>\n<h2>10.

Adorned with gold-leaf frescoes and chandeliers, the resort could even spoil you for camping: Aside from its plush rooms and villas, the resort features several luxe tents, accented with block-printed fabrics, golden thread and post-maharaja-era A/C. And lest you think you could lose yourself in the 32 acres of resort grounds, you can always call reception, using one of the path-side phones, and request that a golf cart come fetch you. Even with its over-the-top vibes, the hotel ranked highly for good value.</p>\n<h2>9.

Readers applauded the friendly, above-and-beyond staffers, who pride themselves on overhearing your wishes, then granting them—like finding that pretty feather you saw on the trail; readers also liked the fabulous log cabins with stone fireplaces and high-end Western art. The hotel tied for third in the U.S. for its upscale take on ranch cuisine, like grilled Texas quail with bourbon sauce, or espresso mousse for dessert.</p>\n<h2>8.

You get free use of bicycles during your stay, and the kids club offers such diversions as pirate treasure hunts, crabbing lessons or pointers from the resort’s golf instructors. Since the kids are occupied, the grown-ups have more freedom to play tennis, go horseback riding or just sit in a rocker—an activity called “porching” here—while being handed a glass of sweet tea. The resort is about to expand by 150 more rooms, but still ranked at No. 5 in the world for its quaint design.</p>\n<h2>7.

Once you’ve checked in, you can also ride, for free, one of the hotel’s four shuttle boats, which make nearly 650 trips a day to three area piers. The hotel made the survey’s top 5 for its executive-friendly rooms (all of which have views of the Chao Phraya River): they come with two international-direct-dial phones, your own fax number and a fresh bowl of fortifying fruit every day. For decompressing after your meetings, the hotel’s spa—featuring the signature Royal Thai massage, unlocking 10 pressure points—also ranked in the world’s top 10.</p>\n<h2>6.

One staffer in particular was named repeatedly: Antonio the bartender, beloved for his disarming demeanor and world-class martinis. Even if you never venture into the hotel’s intimate bar, you’ll be greeted on arrival by a glass of bubbly or a cup of freshly brewed tea. Rooms are regularly re-stocked with fresh flowers and fruit, as well as nightly treats and an old-school hot water bottle.</p>\n<h2>5. Castello di Casole in Casole d&#8217;Elsa, Tuscany</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-castello-di-casole.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351206\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-castello-di-casole.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-castello-di-casole\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Castello di Casole</span></p>\n<p>Readers were exuberant about <a href=\"http://www.castellodicasole.com/activities\" target=\"_blank\">this hotel</a>, which was built around a 10<sup>th</sup> century castle on 4,200 acres, because they felt immediately connected to the Tuscan landscape: The hotel also won 1<sup>st</sup>-place ties in categories such as romance, design and cuisine. All rooms come with welcome bottles of estate-made extra virgin oil and <em>vino</em>, while the bilingual concierges can help set up dinner reservations, tours or cooking classes. Indeed, the “home cooking” at the hotel’s Ristorante Tosca may have been a big part of guests feeling connected, too, thanks to dishes like the spinach risotto with duck breast and raspberries, or house-made Sicilian pistachio spaghetti with wild boar from the hotel’s preserve.</p>\n<h2>4. The Inn at Little Washington in Washington, VA</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-inn-at-little-washington.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351210\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-inn-at-little-washington.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-inn-at-little-washington\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Inn at Little Washington</span></p>\n<p>At first glance, <a href=\"http://www.theinnatlittlewashington.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this small property</a> in rural Virginia is primarily a foodie magnet, run by James Beard Award-winner Patrick O’Connell. But readers awarded it the first-place tie for service because they said they were treated as though there was just one room here, not 24. Housekeeping tidies up your room not once (or twice) but three times time a day, and your rate includes both breakfast and afternoon tea. One reader liked how his waiter, at breakfast, drew him a map of local produce stands worth visiting. The locally-sourced restaurant—with a menu emphasizing classic French cuisine and a 14,000-bottle wine cellar—also earned the Inn at Little Washington the No. 1 cuisine ranking among U.S hotels.</p>\n<h2>3.

(The hotel’s head concierge belongs to Les Clefs d’Or, but merely goes by “Big John.”) If you stay in a suite, you’ll even get the automatic services of a footman, dressed in a scarlet tailcoat and a gold-trimmed vest. The 69-room, family-owned hotel also made the top 20 for its cuisine—an elegant take on English classics—and the Goring Dining Room won its first Michelin star this year. For brunch, try the lobster-accented Eggs Drumkilbo, once the favorite of the Queen Mum.</p>\n<h2>2. Hotel 41 in London</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-hotel-41-london.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351209\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-hotel-41-london.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-hotel-41-london\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of 41 London</span></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.41hotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">boutique hotel</a>’s tucked-away location—across from Buckingham Palace’s Royal Mews—gives it an air of exclusivity, but its staffer-to-guest ratio (2 to 1) really brings home the hotel’s commitment to service. The 41 also got raves from readers for keeping you well-fed: the rotating selection of complimentary tea and treats runs from breakfast time until 1 a.m. Despite the upscale environs, readers commented that the friendly service is never stuffy: One commented that the family’s cat enjoyed the pet-friendly property so much that even she didn’t want to leave. With its striking black-and-white rooms, the hotel also made the survey’s Europe top 10 for cool design.</p>\n<h2>1. The Oberoi Udaivilas in Udaipur, India</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-oberoi-udaivilas.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351211\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/wbtophotels-1-oberoi-udaivilas.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=640\" alt=\"WBTOPHOTELS-1-oberoi-udaivilas\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a> <span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Oberoi</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-udaipur\" target=\"_blank\">This dome-topped resort</a> on the banks of Lake Pichola was once a royal hunting ground, and it tied for first place by still making guests feel like maharajas. Readers loved the private boat ride you take across the lake to arrive at the hotel (and for a fee, you can take a covered <em>shikara</em> back on the water at sundown, for canapés and stargazing). The hotel also tied for first in the survey for its rooms, which come with elegant dark woods and peacock-blue accents (to match the feathered creatures wandering outside), as well as a 24-hour, on-call butler. Given the views of the lake and city, the hotel also ranked at the top for its prime locale.</p>\n<p><em>This article was <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/the-worlds-best-hotel-service\" target=\"_blank\">previously published</a> on</em> Travel + Leisure. <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">T+L</a> <em>is a content partner of Fortune.com.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more on the hospitality industry, watch this Fortune video:</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"41\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3881422032001-41\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3881422032001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Z4Lo0I\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dchristophertkaczyk%2Cdisruptors%2Ctravelandleisure%26ch%3D%26topic%3Ddisruptors&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>More good reads from</strong> <em>T+L</em><strong>:</strong><br />\n• <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/new-york-comedy-festival\" target=\"_blank\">Get Your Tickets to the New York Comedy Festival</a><br />\n• <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/nanette-lepore-art-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Nanette Lepore’s New Art Gallery is in Her Living Room</a><br />\n• <a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/new-york-city-ballet-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">The Newest Ballerinas on Instagram and Hemingway&#8217;s Michigan</a></p>\n",

The hotel is offering an &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.mandarinoriental.com/washington/hotel-offers/electrifying-getaway/\" target=\"_blank\">electrifying getaway</a>&#8221; promotion between September 8 and December 15, 2015. Check in for a maximum of two nights and, among such perks as a spa treatment, European breakfast, and cocktail and hors d&#8217;oeuvres reception, you have the use of a Tesla Model S for the duration of your stay.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s only one car available, so planning a booking in advance is a must, but this isn&#8217;t the first time Tesla and hotels have been linked at the marketing hip. Upscale properties like to dangle the allure of a high-profile ride, while the auto manufacturer gets exposure to high net-worth individuals who might be a candidate for one of their vehicles.</p>\n<p>For example, Tesla has held a test drive event at the <a href=\"my.teslamotors.com/event/experience-model-s-mandarin-oriental-miami\" target=\"_blank\">Mandarin Oriental Miami</a> in May. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mo_newyork/status/622072565792677888\" target=\"_blank\">Mandarin Oriental NY has a Tesla house car</a> that it welcomed on Twitter as its &#8220;newest addition.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re in <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/findus/location/charger/dc621\" target=\"_blank\">Atlanta and need to charge your Tesla</a>, you can stop by that city&#8217;s Mandarin Oriental for a free plug in.</p>\n<p>Other hotels have used the Tesla in promotions as well. The Ritz-Carlton Beijing at the end of May presented &#8220;Tesla Tea Time,&#8221; combining traditional English afternoon tea and a Model S test drive.

Lauderdale, Florida, which boasts &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-victoria-park.html#map_closed\" target=\"_blank\">cable TV, microwave, and small refrigerator</a>&#8221; in every room and suite, also notes that it has a Tesla charging station available.</p>\n<p>The ultimate close connection between the Tesla name and an overnight stay might have happened in January when a Phoenix, Arizona man tried <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/25/tesla-model-s-hotel-airbnb/\" target=\"_blank\">renting out his Tesla</a> on Airbnb for $85 a night. He offered an <a href=\"http://teslarenter.com/tesla-hotel/\" target=\"_blank\">8-inch air mattress</a> in the back of the car with the seats folded down. But he gave up, as it &#8220;really wasn&#8217;t practical.&#8221;</p>\n",

Spoil-worthy service may be the Four Seasons’ most unifying quality (pool attendants with heated towels, on-demand BMWs), but the brand is also known for being family-friendly and accessible. Take the new five-star Four Seasons Resort Orlando, for example. On-site character breakfasts spoil youngsters, while parents can indulge in the spa’s exclusive touch treatment with birchwood massage sticks and hot basalt stones. Our only qualm? There is no Four Seasons loyalty program with which devout guests can express their affection.</p>\n",

His board seats included CustomMade, Kinvey and PillPack.</p>\n<p>Word is that he and Accomplice just weren&#8217;t a great fit for each other, and that Karlan has not yet settled on his next move. It is unclear if Accomplice plans to add a fourth general partner to replace Karlan. The firm currently is investing out of a $200 million fund that closed just this past summer.</p>\n<p>Neither Accomplice nor Karlen responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>In other Accomplice news, the firm has quietly hired a CFO: Travis MacInnes, who previously was VP of finance with Berkshire Partners.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://GetTermSheet.com\">Get Term Sheet</a>, our daily newsletter on deals &amp; deal-makers.</em></p>\n",

In the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model pioneered by Salesforce <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CRM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/salesforce-com-483/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CRM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, customers pay per user per month for their sales or marketing applications, although to be fair, Salesforce and its rivals typically want a one-year up-front payment (three years is better). So the difference between the sales of old-school on-premises software vs. the &#8220;new-world&#8221; of SaaS <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2013/12/08/whatever-happened-to-the-pay-as-you-go-beauty-of-saas/\">is narrowing.</a> (And Salesforce is now 16-years-old, so that new world is getting long in the tooth.)</p>\n<p>Still, most companies expect their overall cost to be less when they move to a SaaS model, and that expectation is problematic for the legacy software providers.</p>\n<p>Another wrinkle: AWS, no longer just about basic infrastructure, has added an array of higher-end database, workflow, analytics, and other services that compete more directly with what Oracle, Microsoft<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, IBM and others offer.</p>\n<p>Currently, businesses can run Oracle databases on AWS, as long as they pay Oracle for that license.

I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody,&#8221; Trump said. (Here is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/12/16/donald-trump-cnn-gop-debate-internet-comments-sot.cnn\">CNN&#8217;s video </a>of his remarks.)</p>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/08/technology/donald-trump-internet/\">Trump referred</a> to &#8220;closing the Internet up in some way&#8221; when he called for <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/08/trump-muslim-ban-business/\">a ban on the immigration of Muslims </a>to the U.S.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, President Xi said nations should be able to control their own online destiny. Speaking at the World Internet Conference in China&#8217;s Zhejiang province, Xi said countries should be able to set their developmental and regulatory policies, in what the BBC said was a signal that cybersecurity and controls are now a priority for Xi&#8217;s government.</p>\n<p>Calls to segment and isolate portions of the Internet flies in the face of what the worldwide network was built to do—provide a boundary-less communications conduit for people and businesses.</p>\n<p>China has long had a problematic track record here, at least from a U.S. point of view. The country has a long history of censorship and controls, which have posed a hurdle to U.S. businesses trying to penetrate that market.

That way, in theory, you can see if your questions will be &#8220;write, read, or compute heavy&#8221; and better anticipate where performance bottlenecks could lurk, <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/12/BigQuery-cost-controls-now-let-you-set-a-daily-maximum-for-query-costs.html\">according to a blog post by Tino Tereshko</a>, a technical program manager for Google. That means perhaps a better, more efficient query to begin with and a lesser bill for processing it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The big public cloud players—led by pioneer Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Web Services—came to the fore because small startup companies, and increasingly internal developers at big companies, saw them as a great way to get work done without having to requisition (and pay for) additional servers and storage. But now, they have to convince IT departments and their bosses, that their services are suited for big business use. That means more focus on predictable costs and more IT-friendly controls going forward.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdata/comments/3jnam1/whats_your_preference_for_running_jobs_in_the_aws/cur518e\">RedShift</a> is Amazon&#8217;s closest competitor to BigQuery, but is different in how complex it is to deploy and scale, particularly across regions,&#8221; said David Mytton, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.serverdensity.com/\">Server Density</a>, a company that monitors server performance for customers. &#8220;In contrast, you just throw data at BigQuery and it handles scaling and redundancy with much simpler pricing.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amazon&#8217;s done a lot of that work with products like <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2013/03/04/lookout-below-amazon-offers-free-trial-of-trusted-advisor-monitoring-tool/\">Trusted Advisor</a> that help IT staff ensure they&#8217;re running the best resources for the job and not over-buying cloud resources.

Google, on the other hand, still faces questions about how business-friendly its cloud services are, and even how serious it is about the cloud business. That&#8217;s why the company recently named former VMware chief executive <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/google-diane-greene-cloud/\">Diane Greene</a> to head its cloud business.</p>\n<p><i>For more on Google, check out the following Fortune video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"44\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4611163888001-44\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4611163888001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Mf4h7d\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dautonomouscars%2Cgoogle%2Cgoogleselfdrivingcars%2Clarrypage%2Cselfdrivingcars%2Cspeedingtickets%2Ctechexplained%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechexplained&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n<p><em>For more from Barb, you can follow her on Twitter at<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigabarb\">@gigabarb</a>; read her </em>Fortune<em> coverage at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/\">fortune.com/barb-darrow</a>; or subscribe via her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/feed/\">RSS feed.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>And please <a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, </em>Fortune<em>’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

That had been the grand plan laid out by EMC Chief Executive Joe Tucci to rationalize <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/emc-dell-cloud-proliferation/\">several different cloud businesses</a> from the various <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/30/emc-defends-the-federation/\">EMC Federation</a> companies.</p>\n<p>Now, unsurprisingly, EMC&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EMC\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/emc-121/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EMC</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Information Infrastructure group (EMC II for short) will focus on helping Virtustream sell into big companies running mission-critical applications, according to an internal memo from EMC II Chief Executive David Goulden viewed by <em>Fortune</em>.</p>\n<p>Goulden wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d like to make clear—beyond any doubt—that we, as EMC, are 100% prepared to make those commitments in support of Virtustream’s mission to become &#8216;the&#8217; leading Cloud Service Provider in mission critical enterprise-class cloud IaaS and hybrid cloud.</p></blockquote>\n<p>EMC II sells storage and associated software into big business accounts and is the direct heir to EMC&#8217;s decades-old storage business. Other federation members include VMware<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VMW\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/vmw/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VMW</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, RSA, VCE, Virtustream, and Pivotal. EMC owns 80% of VMware and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/26/emc-expands-cloud-push-with-1-2-billion-buy-of-virtustream/\">bought Virtustream</a> in May for $1.2 billion. EMC and VMware share ownership of Pivotal. You see the complexity here.</p>\n<p>But back to cloud. Going forward EMC II will move its existing EMC storage managed services offerings, VCE cloud managed services, and its Rubicon object storage service into the Virtustream cloud unit, under chief executive Rodney Rogers.</p>\n<p>Goulden also said Virtustream will be part of the vCloud Air Network, although it&#8217;s unclear what, exactly that means given that Virtustream and vCloud would often compete for the same business accounts. And nothing says hypercompetitive like an EMC (or a VMware) salesperson. (Except maybe an Oracle salesperson.)</p>\n<p>EMC had no comment on this story.</p>\n<p>For all the talk of EMC Federation companies being able to sell both with each other and against each other, it&#8217;s hard to see how this will work in the field given that Team EMC faces prodigious competition from Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Web Services and Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> for these accounts. Neither of those cloud giants are burdened with the sort of internal wrangling that EMC is now working through.</p>\n<p>Presumably, once the federation gets all this internal stuff sorted out—Goulden said there will be an update early next year—<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/dell-and-emc-merger-official/\">EMC&#8217;s $67 billion merger with Dell</a> will go through and there will be more massive reorganizations to come.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><em>For more coverage of EMC-Dell deal, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"45\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4552766984001-45\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4552766984001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1QltTap\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbusinessnews%2Cdell%2Cdellbuyout%2Cdellemcmerger%2Cdellprivatecompany%2Cdellstockprice%2Cdellvmware%2Cemccorporationbuyout%2Cemcstockprice%2Cemcvmware%2Clargesttechmergerofalltime%2Cma%2Cmarkettrends%2Cmichaeldell%2Ctechmergers%2Cvmwarebuyout%2Cvmwarestockprice%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dmarkettrends&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><em>For more from Barb, you can follow her on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigabarb\">@gigabarb</a>; read her </em>Fortune<em> coverage at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/\">fortune.com/barb-darrow</a>; or subscribe via her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/feed/\">RSS feed.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>And please <a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, </em>Fortune<em>’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>Donald Trump, the Republican U.S. presidential candidate, and Chinese president Xi Jinping—an unlikely pair if there ever was one—agree on one important point: Nations should be able to control the Internet and who can access what.</p>\n<p>Tuesday night during the GOP debate, Trump said the U.S. should keep ISIS from using the Internet to recruit young people and plot against the U.S.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to get brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places to figure out a way,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them using our Internet to take our young, impressionable youth,&#8221; Trump said in a response to a question from CNN&#8217;s Wolf Blitzer.</p>\n<p>He added that the U.S. first needs to &#8220;figure out a way so ISIS cannot use the Internet and second we should be able to penetrate the Internet to find out where ISIS is. I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody,&#8221; Trump said. (Here is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/12/16/donald-trump-cnn-gop-debate-internet-comments-sot.cnn\">CNN&#8217;s video </a>of his remarks.)</p>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/08/technology/donald-trump-internet/\">Trump referred</a> to &#8220;closing the Internet up in some way&#8221; when he called for <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/08/trump-muslim-ban-business/\">a ban on the immigration of Muslims </a>to the U.S.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, President Xi said nations should be able to control their own online destiny. Speaking at the World Internet Conference in China&#8217;s Zhejiang province, Xi said countries should be able to set their developmental and regulatory policies, in what the BBC said was a signal that cybersecurity and controls are now a priority for Xi&#8217;s government.</p>\n<p>Calls to segment and isolate portions of the Internet flies in the face of what the worldwide network was built to do—provide a boundary-less communications conduit for people and businesses.</p>\n<p>China has long had a problematic track record here, at least from a U.S. point of view. The country has a long history of censorship and controls, which have posed a hurdle to U.S. businesses trying to penetrate that market. It blocks hundreds of Internet sites based outside the country, for example.</p>\n<p>Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> famously decided to close its search engine business in China five years ago in part because of these rules, but in the past two years other U.S. cloud providers—Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Web Services, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and IBM <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"IBM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm-24/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">IBM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> for example—have rushed into China to set up cloud computing services, mostly via partnerships with Chinese national companies. The lure of the potential market size is just too strong to stay away. Even Google is <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/04/google-china/\">starting to inch back into China.</a></p>\n<p>And China has its own Internet giants in the form of <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/08/alibabas-chief-comes-to-u-s-to-drum-up-business/\">Alibaba</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BABA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/baba/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BABA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, Baidu <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BIDU\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/bidu/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BIDU</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/07/tencent-wefire-united-states/\">Tencent</a>, all of which want to keep their hold on Chinese business while also expanding outside.</p>\n<p>Xi&#8217;s point is that China, with its estimated 650 million Internet surfers, should be at the table when Internet and cybersecurity policies are decided. The security issue is a particular sore point given that U.S. and Chinese officials have traded charges of <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/evidence-of-chinas-state-supported-hacking-grows/\">state-sponsored espionage</a> over the past few years.</p>\n<p>Trump went on to clarify that he only wanted to close Internet access in certain areas where ISIS is strong so his call to action is more circumscribed than China&#8217;s Internet policy. He also holds no official office so his words, despite the media frenzy, are a long way from reality. But there is a receptive audience to what he&#8217;s saying, so it would be foolhardy to disregard his message entirely.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"39\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4663267864001-39\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4663267864001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1NTjRuu\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3D2016republicandebate%2Ccarlyfiorina%2Cchrischristie%2Cdonaldtrump%2Cjebbush%2Cmarcorubio%2Crandpaul%2Ctedcruz%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3D2016republicandebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>For more from Barb, you can follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigabarb\">@gigabarb</a>; read her </em>Fortune<em> coverage at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/\">fortune.com/barb-darrow</a>; or subscribe via her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/feed/\">RSS feed.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>And please <a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, </em>Fortune<em>’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

And while it has been positioned as a low-cost big data analytics option, the fact is that queries can run a long time across a ton of data and that can run up quite a bill.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That&#8217;s not the sort of predictability big companies want when it comes to any technology. And Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> really wants to convince big companies that its cloud technology services are <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/18/google-enterprise-cloud/\">ready for prime time.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That&#8217;s why Google is now offering potential inquisitors a way to set a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/cost-controls\">&#8220;custom quota&#8221;</a> to ensure that the number crunching on a specified project does not exceed a pre-set daily limit.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/query-plan-explanation\">Query Explain</a> feature promises to lay out, step by step, how BigQuery will go about processing the question on the table in advance. That way, in theory, you can see if your questions will be &#8220;write, read, or compute heavy&#8221; and better anticipate where performance bottlenecks could lurk, <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/12/BigQuery-cost-controls-now-let-you-set-a-daily-maximum-for-query-costs.html\">according to a blog post by Tino Tereshko</a>, a technical program manager for Google. That means perhaps a better, more efficient query to begin with and a lesser bill for processing it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The big public cloud players—led by pioneer Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Web Services—came to the fore because small startup companies, and increasingly internal developers at big companies, saw them as a great way to get work done without having to requisition (and pay for) additional servers and storage. But now, they have to convince IT departments and their bosses, that their services are suited for big business use. That means more focus on predictable costs and more IT-friendly controls going forward.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdata/comments/3jnam1/whats_your_preference_for_running_jobs_in_the_aws/cur518e\">RedShift</a> is Amazon&#8217;s closest competitor to BigQuery, but is different in how complex it is to deploy and scale, particularly across regions,&#8221; said David Mytton, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.serverdensity.com/\">Server Density</a>, a company that monitors server performance for customers. &#8220;In contrast, you just throw data at BigQuery and it handles scaling and redundancy with much simpler pricing.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amazon&#8217;s done a lot of that work with products like <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2013/03/04/lookout-below-amazon-offers-free-trial-of-trusted-advisor-monitoring-tool/\">Trusted Advisor</a> that help IT staff ensure they&#8217;re running the best resources for the job and not over-buying cloud resources. Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, with its business-focused roots, is making strides selling Azure as a good corporate citizen. Google, on the other hand, still faces questions about how business-friendly its cloud services are, and even how serious it is about the cloud business. That&#8217;s why the company recently named former VMware chief executive <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/google-diane-greene-cloud/\">Diane Greene</a> to head its cloud business.</p>\n<p><i>For more on Google, check out the following Fortune video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"41\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4611163888001-41\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4611163888001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Mf4h7d\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dautonomouscars%2Cgoogle%2Cgoogleselfdrivingcars%2Clarrypage%2Cselfdrivingcars%2Cspeedingtickets%2Ctechexplained%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechexplained&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n</div>\n<p><em>For more from Barb, you can follow her on Twitter at<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigabarb\">@gigabarb</a>; read her </em>Fortune<em> coverage at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/\">fortune.com/barb-darrow</a>; or subscribe via her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/feed/\">RSS feed.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>And please <a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, </em>Fortune<em>’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

That had been the grand plan laid out by EMC Chief Executive Joe Tucci to rationalize <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/emc-dell-cloud-proliferation/\">several different cloud businesses</a> from the various <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/30/emc-defends-the-federation/\">EMC Federation</a> companies.</p>\n<p>Now, unsurprisingly, EMC&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EMC\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/emc-121/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EMC</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Information Infrastructure group (EMC II for short) will focus on helping Virtustream sell into big companies running mission-critical applications, according to an internal memo from EMC II Chief Executive David Goulden viewed by <em>Fortune</em>.</p>\n<p>Goulden wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d like to make clear—beyond any doubt—that we, as EMC, are 100% prepared to make those commitments in support of Virtustream’s mission to become &#8216;the&#8217; leading Cloud Service Provider in mission critical enterprise-class cloud IaaS and hybrid cloud.</p></blockquote>\n<p>EMC II sells storage and associated software into big business accounts and is the direct heir to EMC&#8217;s decades-old storage business. Other federation members include VMware<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VMW\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/vmw/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VMW</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, RSA, VCE, Virtustream, and Pivotal. EMC owns 80% of VMware and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/26/emc-expands-cloud-push-with-1-2-billion-buy-of-virtustream/\">bought Virtustream</a> in May for $1.2 billion. EMC and VMware share ownership of Pivotal. You see the complexity here.</p>\n<p>But back to cloud. Going forward EMC II will move its existing EMC storage managed services offerings, VCE cloud managed services, and its Rubicon object storage service into the Virtustream cloud unit, under chief executive Rodney Rogers.</p>\n<p>Goulden also said Virtustream will be part of the vCloud Air Network, although it&#8217;s unclear what, exactly that means given that Virtustream and vCloud would often compete for the same business accounts. And nothing says hypercompetitive like an EMC (or a VMware) salesperson. (Except maybe an Oracle salesperson.)</p>\n<p>EMC had no comment on this story.</p>\n<p>For all the talk of EMC Federation companies being able to sell both with each other and against each other, it&#8217;s hard to see how this will work in the field given that Team EMC faces prodigious competition from Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> Web Services and Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> for these accounts. Neither of those cloud giants are burdened with the sort of internal wrangling that EMC is now working through.</p>\n<p>Presumably, once the federation gets all this internal stuff sorted out—Goulden said there will be an update early next year—<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/12/dell-and-emc-merger-official/\">EMC&#8217;s $67 billion merger with Dell</a> will go through and there will be more massive reorganizations to come.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><em>For more coverage of EMC-Dell deal, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"42\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4552766984001-42\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4552766984001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1QltTap\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbusinessnews%2Cdell%2Cdellbuyout%2Cdellemcmerger%2Cdellprivatecompany%2Cdellstockprice%2Cdellvmware%2Cemccorporationbuyout%2Cemcstockprice%2Cemcvmware%2Clargesttechmergerofalltime%2Cma%2Cmarkettrends%2Cmichaeldell%2Ctechmergers%2Cvmwarebuyout%2Cvmwarestockprice%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dmarkettrends&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><em>For more from Barb, you can follow her on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigabarb\">@gigabarb</a>; read her </em>Fortune<em> coverage at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/\">fortune.com/barb-darrow</a>; or subscribe via her <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/feed/\">RSS feed.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>And please <a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, </em>Fortune<em>’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

It also said that being out of the spotlight of the public markets would give it breathing room to fix Avon in its home market.</p>\n<p>Avon will use the $605 million in proceeds from the deal to, among other things, pay down its debt. It is also suspending its dividend.</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs and Centerview advised Avon on the financial aspects of the deal. Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP served as Avon’s legal counsel.

          "title": "Uber and its Rivals Now Have A Big Investor in Common",
          "content": "<p>There were two major developments on Thursday in the world of ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>First, Uber is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation\">in the midst of raising</a> $2.1 billion in new private equity funding at a whopping $62 billion valuation. For context, that&#8217;s higher than the market cap of General Motors <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/general-motors-6/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and it was done at fairly standard terms (1x liquidation preference, no &#8220;ratchets&#8221;). Second, four Uber rivals from around the globe <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/03/lyft-didi-ola-and-grabtaxi-partner-in-global-tech-service-alliance-to-rival-uber/\">have signed</a> a &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; through which they&#8217;ll work together on both technology and services. The new partners are Lyft (U.S.), Didi Kuaidi (China), GrabTaxi (SouthEast Asia) and Ola (India).</p>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s now Uber vs. the world. Which is why it&#8217;s so surprising that Uber&#8217;s new financing round is being co-led by Tiger Global, which previously invested in Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi, Ola and Lyft (that last one is indirect, as Lyft raised money from Didi Kuaidi). Keep your enemies so close that they&#8217;re on your cap table?</p>\n<p>Sources familiar with the situation say that Tiger is committing more to Uber in this round than it invested in any of the other three companies, which helped make Uber more comfortable with its inclusion. For Tiger, it was less about hedging and more about a platform coverage (i.e., there can be multiple winners, particularly as some of the companies expand beyond consumer transportation). Moreover, the two sides worked out an information-sharing plan that would avoid either one from being put in an awkward position (which, presumably, means very little information will actually be shared).</p>\n<p>The deal also reflects how much of Uber&#8217;s growth is outside of the U.S., despite regulatory challenges and homegrown rivals. For example, five of its ten largest global markets are in China, where a company spokesperson claims it has between a 25% and 30% market share of all completed private car trips. In India, Uber claims around a 40% market share.</p>\n<p>From a fundraising perspective, that international growth means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uber feels more confident about its competitive position, so is willing to take on an investor like Tiger Global. This is a far cry from last year, when Uber CEO Travis Kalanick <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/12/uber-travis-kalanick-controversy\">openly bragged</a> to <em>Vanity Fair </em>about trying to disrupt Lyft&#8217;s fundraising efforts.</li>\n<li>Uber wants to maintain momentum &#8212; including adding new markets &#8212; but needs new outside capital to do so. But because it already has raised so much money from so many big investors, it can no longer be quite so choosy when it comes to new shareholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Uber has not yet closed the new financing round, nor does it have verbal commitments for the entire $2.1 billion. Expect that it will follow the same process we&#8217;ve seen in the past, where it holds a quick first close in order to set the terms &#8212; in this case with Tiger and T. Rowe Price &#8212; and then works to fill out the remaining book.</p>\n<p>For Uber&#8217;s most recent stock certification in Delaware, where the new valuation was first disclosed, see below (courtesy of private market data provider VC Experts):</p>\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/292112058/content?start_page=1&view_mode=&access_key=key-w8Jor20noNGZizZvcjIO\" data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_292112058\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/292112058\">View this document on Scribd</a></div>\n",

While discussions are believed to be in the early stages, the board may <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/02/yahoo-last-resort-private-equity/\">ultimately decide to put its core Internet business</a> up for sale including its media properties, e-mail, and advertising.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/02/5-notes-on-the-yahoo-sale/\">All that would be left</a> of the company would be its hugely valuable stakes in China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BABA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/baba/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BABA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and Yahoo Japan, a joint venture with Japan-based conglomerate SoftBank, along with some cash. It&#8217;s also possible, however, that Yahoo&#8217;s board will decide against a sale or may sell just a few pieces of the business.</p>\n<p>Speculation about which companies may be interested in Yahoo is rampant.

Private equity firms are also said to be lining up to bid.</p>\n<p>Investors hoping for a deal sent Yahoo&#8217;s shares <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"YHOO\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/yahoo-561/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">YHOO</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> up 5% on Wednesday after news of a possible sale emerged the night before<em>. </em>But others have questioned whether Yahoo is really that valuable.</p>\n<p>Critics point to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/28/yahoo-alibaba-spinoff-irs/\">Yahoo&#8217;s desire to spin-off its stake in Alibaba</a>, which is valued at around $30 billion, as well as its stake in Yahoo Japan, valued at $8 billion, versus the company&#8217;s own market capitalization of nearly $32 billion, as proof that the core of its business is worth nothing. What&#8217;s worse, Yahoo shareholders have watched as the company&#8217;s revenue has steadily declined and its position in the Internet industry&#8217;s pecking order erode.</p>\n<p>The truth, however, is that the company&#8217;s core Internet business is actually a cash cow that, in the right hands, could be an extremely valuable asset.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things you get access to is a billion monthly users so that helps you to cross-sell other products,&#8221; Bob Peck, an analyst SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told <em>Fortune</em> in an interview. &#8220;You also get access to the advertising technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John Blackledge, head of Internet industry research at Cowen, says Yahoo&#8217;s value is in the cash it generates. He estimated that in 2016, alone, Yahoo core would generate $780 million in operating profit. That&#8217;s before any buyer cut costs and hires new management. Even after taxes and other expenses, Blackledge says, Yahoo core would generate even more cash than now, like an annuity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There’s value in [Yahoo core] that hasn’t been understood or appreciated,&#8221; says Scott Kessler, an analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ. &#8220;I’m hardly saying this is a great company with tremendous growth, but this is still a powerful global brand. A lot of companies would be interested in acquiring them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For its part, Yahoo declined to comment about any possible sale, and, at least publicly, is committed to focus on growth. The company signed a search ad deal with Google in October, and has recently reported modest growth in its advertising business after years of mostly stagnation. In the third quarter, Yahoo&#8217;s revenue rose 7% to $1.2 billion compared to the same period last year. The company&#8217;s search and display ad revenue grew 13% and 14%, respectively, and it&#8217;s &#8220;Mavens&#8221; business (Mobile, video, native, and social advertising) saw an increase of 43% year-over-year to $422 million.</p>\n<p>While that may not be groundbreaking performance compared with Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook-242/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, it could attract buyers who ultimately want a steady stream of cash.</p>\n<p>After all, it&#8217;s happened before.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Verizon said that it would acquire AOL for nearly $4.4 billion. A vestige of the 1990s, AOL was in a similar position as Yahoo. It still had rather impressive ad revenue and substantial cash flow, but its business was slowly shrinking.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Kessler says that Verizon could be actively seeking to buy Yahoo buy for all of the same reasons that lured it to AOL. The difference here, is that Yahoo may be even more attractive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t see why people should perceive Yahoo to be different than AOL,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Yahoo is more global, and Yahoo has a stronger balance sheet than AOL did. I think there’s a lot there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Questions remain, though, over how much Yahoo&#8217;s core business is worth to the right buyer. Analysts surveyed by<i> Fortune</i> value it at anywhere from $1.9 billion and $8 billion. Most analysts, however, say that Yahoo&#8217;s core will likely fetch between $5 billion and $8 billion. The wide range is due to the differences in the way analysts value Yahoo&#8217;s stake in its Asian investments, and how much cash would remain with what&#8217;s left of the company.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the sales price would be a far cry from the days of old when Yahoo could have fetched tens of billions more. In 2008, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> proposed a $44.6 billion acquisition, a 62% percent premium to the company&#8217;s stock price at the time. That was before Alibaba became such a valuable asset. While the deal would have given Microsoft all of Yahoo, the differences between the Yahoo of 2008 and Yahoo&#8217;s core now are not all that different. It would have been one of the biggest technology industry acquisitions in history, and looking back, it would have given shareholders far more cash.</p>\n<p>Yahoo ultimately rebuffed Microsoft&#8217;s offer and set its own course in hopes of a turnaround. Instead, things got worse.</p>\n<p>Now, the board is back in the same spot, mulling a possible sale of Yahoo&#8217;s core business. The implications are major. One possibility is that Yahoo would cancel the spin off of its Alibaba shares and keep them. After selling its core Internet assets, Yahoo would essentially become a holding company for its Asian investments.</p>\n<p>The process could take months. But as far as Kessler and other analysts <em>Fortune</em> spoke to are concerned, deciding against a sale against may be a grave mistake.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a lot of opportunities and options,&#8221; Kessler says of Yahoo. &#8220;The time might be ripe.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>For more on Marissa Mayer and Yahoo, check out the following</em> Fortune<i> video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"47\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3605357465001-47\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3605357465001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/21w8bDY\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dmarissamayer%2Ctechdebate%2Cyahooyhoo%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><i><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter about the business of technology.</i></p>\n",

              "title": "Uber and its Rivals Now Have A Big Investor in Common",
              "content": "<p>There were two major developments on Thursday in the world of ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>First, Uber is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation\">in the midst of raising</a> $2.1 billion in new private equity funding at a whopping $62 billion valuation. For context, that&#8217;s higher than the market cap of General Motors <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/general-motors-6/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GM</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and it was done at fairly standard terms (1x liquidation preference, no &#8220;ratchets&#8221;). Second, four Uber rivals from around the globe <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/03/lyft-didi-ola-and-grabtaxi-partner-in-global-tech-service-alliance-to-rival-uber/\">have signed</a> a &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; through which they&#8217;ll work together on both technology and services. The new partners are Lyft (U.S.), Didi Kuaidi (China), GrabTaxi (SouthEast Asia) and Ola (India).</p>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s now Uber vs. the world. Which is why it&#8217;s so surprising that Uber&#8217;s new financing round is being co-led by Tiger Global, which previously invested in Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi, Ola and Lyft (that last one is indirect, as Lyft raised money from Didi Kuaidi). Keep your enemies so close that they&#8217;re on your cap table?</p>\n<p>Sources familiar with the situation say that Tiger is committing more to Uber in this round than it invested in any of the other three companies, which helped make Uber more comfortable with its inclusion. For Tiger, it was less about hedging and more about a platform coverage (i.e., there can be multiple winners, particularly as some of the companies expand beyond consumer transportation). Moreover, the two sides worked out an information-sharing plan that would avoid either one from being put in an awkward position (which, presumably, means very little information will actually be shared).</p>\n<p>The deal also reflects how much of Uber&#8217;s growth is outside of the U.S., despite regulatory challenges and homegrown rivals. For example, five of its ten largest global markets are in China, where a company spokesperson claims it has between a 25% and 30% market share of all completed private car trips. In India, Uber claims around a 40% market share.</p>\n<p>From a fundraising perspective, that international growth means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uber feels more confident about its competitive position, so is willing to take on an investor like Tiger Global. This is a far cry from last year, when Uber CEO Travis Kalanick <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/12/uber-travis-kalanick-controversy\">openly bragged</a> to <em>Vanity Fair </em>about trying to disrupt Lyft&#8217;s fundraising efforts.</li>\n<li>Uber wants to maintain momentum &#8212; including adding new markets &#8212; but needs new outside capital to do so. But because it already has raised so much money from so many big investors, it can no longer be quite so choosy when it comes to new shareholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Uber has not yet closed the new financing round, nor does it have verbal commitments for the entire $2.1 billion. Expect that it will follow the same process we&#8217;ve seen in the past, where it holds a quick first close in order to set the terms &#8212; in this case with Tiger and T. Rowe Price &#8212; and then works to fill out the remaining book.</p>\n<p>For Uber&#8217;s most recent stock certification in Delaware, where the new valuation was first disclosed, see below (courtesy of private market data provider VC Experts):</p>\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/292112058/content?start_page=1&view_mode=&access_key=key-w8Jor20noNGZizZvcjIO\" data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_292112058\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/292112058\">View this document on Scribd</a></div>\n",

It&#8217;s also possible, however, that Yahoo&#8217;s board will decide against a sale or may sell just a few pieces of the business.</p>\n<p>Speculation about which companies may be interested in Yahoo is rampant.

Private equity firms are also said to be lining up to bid.</p>\n<p>Investors hoping for a deal sent Yahoo&#8217;s shares <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"YHOO\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/yahoo-561/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">YHOO</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> up 5% on Wednesday after news of a possible sale emerged the night before<em>. </em>But others have questioned whether Yahoo is really that valuable.</p>\n<p>Critics point to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/28/yahoo-alibaba-spinoff-irs/\">Yahoo&#8217;s desire to spin-off its stake in Alibaba</a>, which is valued at around $30 billion, as well as its stake in Yahoo Japan, valued at $8 billion, versus the company&#8217;s own market capitalization of nearly $32 billion, as proof that the core of its business is worth nothing. What&#8217;s worse, Yahoo shareholders have watched as the company&#8217;s revenue has steadily declined and its position in the Internet industry&#8217;s pecking order erode.</p>\n<p>The truth, however, is that the company&#8217;s core Internet business is actually a cash cow that, in the right hands, could be an extremely valuable asset.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things you get access to is a billion monthly users so that helps you to cross-sell other products,&#8221; Bob Peck, an analyst SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told <em>Fortune</em> in an interview. &#8220;You also get access to the advertising technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John Blackledge, head of Internet industry research at Cowen, says Yahoo&#8217;s value is in the cash it generates. He estimated that in 2016, alone, Yahoo core would generate $780 million in operating profit. That&#8217;s before any buyer cut costs and hires new management. Even after taxes and other expenses, Blackledge says, Yahoo core would generate even more cash than now, like an annuity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There’s value in [Yahoo core] that hasn’t been understood or appreciated,&#8221; says Scott Kessler, an analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ. &#8220;I’m hardly saying this is a great company with tremendous growth, but this is still a powerful global brand. A lot of companies would be interested in acquiring them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For its part, Yahoo declined to comment about any possible sale, and, at least publicly, is committed to focus on growth. The company signed a search ad deal with Google in October, and has recently reported modest growth in its advertising business after years of mostly stagnation. In the third quarter, Yahoo&#8217;s revenue rose 7% to $1.2 billion compared to the same period last year. The company&#8217;s search and display ad revenue grew 13% and 14%, respectively, and it&#8217;s &#8220;Mavens&#8221; business (Mobile, video, native, and social advertising) saw an increase of 43% year-over-year to $422 million.</p>\n<p>While that may not be groundbreaking performance compared with Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> and Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook-242/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, it could attract buyers who ultimately want a steady stream of cash.</p>\n<p>After all, it&#8217;s happened before.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Verizon said that it would acquire AOL for nearly $4.4 billion. A vestige of the 1990s, AOL was in a similar position as Yahoo. It still had rather impressive ad revenue and substantial cash flow, but its business was slowly shrinking.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Kessler says that Verizon could be actively seeking to buy Yahoo buy for all of the same reasons that lured it to AOL. The difference here, is that Yahoo may be even more attractive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t see why people should perceive Yahoo to be different than AOL,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Yahoo is more global, and Yahoo has a stronger balance sheet than AOL did. I think there’s a lot there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Questions remain, though, over how much Yahoo&#8217;s core business is worth to the right buyer. Analysts surveyed by<i> Fortune</i> value it at anywhere from $1.9 billion and $8 billion. Most analysts, however, say that Yahoo&#8217;s core will likely fetch between $5 billion and $8 billion. The wide range is due to the differences in the way analysts value Yahoo&#8217;s stake in its Asian investments, and how much cash would remain with what&#8217;s left of the company.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the sales price would be a far cry from the days of old when Yahoo could have fetched tens of billions more. In 2008, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> proposed a $44.6 billion acquisition, a 62% percent premium to the company&#8217;s stock price at the time. That was before Alibaba became such a valuable asset. While the deal would have given Microsoft all of Yahoo, the differences between the Yahoo of 2008 and Yahoo&#8217;s core now are not all that different. It would have been one of the biggest technology industry acquisitions in history, and looking back, it would have given shareholders far more cash.</p>\n<p>Yahoo ultimately rebuffed Microsoft&#8217;s offer and set its own course in hopes of a turnaround. Instead, things got worse.</p>\n<p>Now, the board is back in the same spot, mulling a possible sale of Yahoo&#8217;s core business. The implications are major. One possibility is that Yahoo would cancel the spin off of its Alibaba shares and keep them. After selling its core Internet assets, Yahoo would essentially become a holding company for its Asian investments.</p>\n<p>The process could take months. But as far as Kessler and other analysts <em>Fortune</em> spoke to are concerned, deciding against a sale against may be a grave mistake.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a lot of opportunities and options,&#8221; Kessler says of Yahoo. &#8220;The time might be ripe.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>For more on Marissa Mayer and Yahoo, check out the following</em> Fortune<i> video:</i></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"17\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3605357465001-17\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3605357465001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/21w8bDY\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dmarissamayer%2Ctechdebate%2Cyahooyhoo%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p><i><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter about the business of technology.</i></p>\n",

But the difference now, in the words of the Deutsche Bank seers, is that “there are open source rivals for almost every major infrastructure and data management software market.”</p>\n<p>The analysts published an accompanying chart that shows that for every important category of business software produced by the likes of Oracle <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ORCL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/oracle-81/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ORCL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, VMware <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VMW\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/vmw/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VMW</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, and others there is a corresponding open-source alternative.

          "content": "<p>Facebook wants to speed up research into artificial intelligence for everyone by making the plans for a massively powered box available to any company that wants to hasten up its efforts to build better facial or voice recognition. The box is called Big Sur, and is twice as fast as Facebook&#8217;s existing gear and will allow it to create neural networks that are twice as large. In the case of AI, bigger neural networks are faster.</p>\n<p>The net result of this speed boost means that the social network could take its <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/15/facebook-ai-moments/\">uncanny facial recognition abilities</a> to your videos in addition to your photos. And because it&#8217;s contributing these designs to the Open Compute Foundation, much like it has done for its server designs and networking gear, other companies can take these designs and build their own AI hardware or even tweak the Big Sur designs to make them better.</p>\n<p>Building hardware for machine learning and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/12/chipmakers-ai/\">artificial intelligence</a> is tough. Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"fb\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook-242/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">fb</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> has spent 18 months perfecting this design, and is using some new chips from Nvidia <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nvda\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/nvidia-553/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nvda</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> to power the boxes. Serkan Piantino, director of engineering at Facebook&#8217;s AI Research, said on a conference call explaining the news, that because of the enormous amount of heat and power drawn by the graphics processing chips used in building the machines, that the team that melted its first enclosure would have gotten a steak dinner. But the challenge in building the hardware wasn&#8217;t reducing the heat from the semiconductors, but rather the amount of power they consumed.</p>\n<p>Yann LeCun, the head of AI research at Facebook, said that negotiating with the data center administrators to take in the necessary power to ensure the machines got the juice they needed was a significant issue. Each box contains 8 GPUs that consume 300 watts each, which is a large power draw. However, Facebook has managed to make the power and heat of the boxes work in its own data centers, which means they should work well in other modern data center facilities.</p>\n<p>These boxes also have the advantage of being about 30% cheaper than existing hardware that is custom-built for AI. For example, a startup called Minds.ai, launched an <a href=\"http://www.datanami.com/2015/12/07/10027/\">Amazon Web Services-like neural network as a service</a> for companies that wanted to speed up their neural network training earlier this week built on custom hardware. As for newer types of machine learning such as <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/next-ai-frontier/\">deep recommendation learning or attention learning</a>, LeCun said there aren&#8217;t a lot of specific changes that are needed on the software side, so boxes like Big Sur could be used with some software modifications.</p>\n<p>It may be that in another year we&#8217;ll see that while <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-08/why-2015-was-a-breakthrough-year-in-artificial-intelligence\">2015 was a big year for advancements in artificial intelligence</a>, that it was just the start of something much bigger enabled by a new generation of powerful hardware.</p>\n<p><em>For more on AI, watch this Fortune video:</em><br />\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"49\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4587395234001-49\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4587395234001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RGzwPn\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dai%2Cartificialintelligence%2Cblakeirving%2Ccyphyworks%2Cdrones%2Cebay%2Cetsy%2Cgodaddy%2Cgrokker%2Chelengreiner%2Cirobot%2Ckatrinalake%2Ckristinasalen%2Clarsbjork%2Clornaborenstein%2Cnewyorkstockexchange%2Cnyse%2Cqlik%2Cquentinclark%2Crjpittman%2Csap%2Cstitchfix%2Cstitchfix%2Ctechcetera%2Ctomfarley%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechcetera&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

          "content": "<p>Simon Anderson, who has been chief executive of DreamHost for nearly five years, is stepping down.</p>\n<p>Anderson confirmed his departure—which has not yet been publicly announced—in an interview with <em>Fortune, </em>saying he is working with DreamHost&#8217;s board to ensure a smooth transition.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: A July 2011 <a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/press/dreamhost-names-simon-anderson-to-serve-as-new-ceo/\">press release</a> announcing his appointment is probably the only such document to note the recipient&#8217;s &#8220;powerful Australian accent and movie star jawline,&#8221; but I digress.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based web hosting company became a force to be reckoned with in the<a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/2014/07/16/how-dreamhost-is-reinventing-itself-with-openstack/\"> OpenStack cloud world</a>, as evidenced by its decision to back successful storage subsystem <a href=\"http://ceph.com/\">Ceph</a>. In 2012, Dreamhost launched <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2012/05/03/inktank-launches-to-change-the-face-of-open-source-storage/\">Inktank</a>, a company offering a commercially supported version of Ceph. <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2014/04/30/wow-red-hats-buying-inktank-for-its-ceph-storage-smarts/\">Red Hat</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"RHT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/rht/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">RHT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> bought Inktank two years later for $175 million.</p>\n<p>Anderson said the new development was an amicable parting of ways—the only major conflict he had with the company founders is that he had wanted to seek additional growth funding while they did not. Over the years Dreamhost, co-founded by Dallas Bethune, Josh Jones, Michael Rodriguez, and Sage Weil, has been largely self-funded. All of the co-founders except Jones are still affiliated with the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their right as founders to take a different view. It&#8217;s their company that they&#8217;ve built over 18 years,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>\n<p>The entrepreneur said he has few other irons in the fire. He co-founded <a href=\"http://akanda.io/\">Akanda</a>, another company dedicated to providing commercial support for open-source technology, this time Astara network virtualization. His co-founders at Akanda include DreamHost vice president of cloud Jonathan LaCour.</p>\n<p>Anderson is also stepping down from<a href=\"https://www.openstack.org/foundation/board-of-directors/\"> the OpenStack Foundation board </a>where his slot will be taken by LaCour. Anderson said he will probably run as an individual board member next year. As for DreamHost leadership, Anderson said the company&#8217;s board and management are conducting a search for a chief executive or general manager.</p>\n<p><em>Fortune</em> reached out to DreamHost for additional comment and will update this story as needed.</p>\n<p><em>For more on cloud technology, check out the Fortune video below.</em><br />\n<span class=\"message_body\"> <div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"50\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4324494644001-50\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4324494644001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1MNZ7jZ\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Camazonwebservices%2Candyjassy%2Cglobalpowerprofile%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Damazon&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></span></p>\n<p><em>For more from Barb, follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigabarb\">@gigabarb.</a> Read her </em>Fortune<em> coverage at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/\">fortune.com/barb-darrow</a> or subscribe via <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/barb-darrow/feed/\">RSS feed.</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Oh!

          "content": "<p>Airbnb wants to make it easier for hosts to make as much money as possible.</p>\n<p>The online home rental startup unveiled a new tool on Thursday that makes it easier for people to automatically set the highest possible price for their home listings without turning off potential customers.</p>\n<p>The new tool, currently only available to a limited number of Airbnb users, is basically an upgrade to a <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/using-data-to-help-set-your-price/\">pricing tool</a> the company introduced in June. That tool suggested the price hosts should charge based on factors like daily demand, the location of their property, and season.</p>\n<p>But hosts had to go into their listing to change the price, potentially on a daily basis. The updated version does the job automatically for the host, which Airbnb hopes will increase adoption.</p>\n<p>That was “more work than our hosts wanted to take on,” said Airbnb product manager Carla Pellicano.</p>\n<p>Hosts that use Smart Pricing, as the new tool is called, set a range of the lowest and highest prices they want to charge. They also must disclose if they rent frequently or infrequently, which impacts the price.</p>\n<p>The technology would likely suggest <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/17/how-uber-surge-pricing-really-works/\">higher prices</a>, sometimes referred to as surge pricing, during peak periods like winter in Palm Springs, the upcoming Super Bowl near San Francisco, and ski season in the case of a mountain chalet. At the same time, it would recommend lower prices during slow periods outside the typical vacation season and when there are no big conventions in town.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make the pricing system more personalized for Airbnb hosts, explained Pellicano. But hosts can decide against changing prices up and down if they prefer not to.</p>\n<p>“There are some hosts who think, for me it is better to have a flat price, I don’t want to confuse guests,” said Pellicano.</p>\n<p>Hotels typically use economists and data scientists to set the price on their rooms based on expected demand, explained Airbnb data scientist Bar Ifrach. But because Airbnb hosts don’t have those type of data crunching resources available to them, the company built a tool to help.</p>\n<p>Airbnb, which takes a commission on each booking, stands to earn more money if hosts maximize their rent without causing high vacancies. The tool is designed to keep apartments and homes full by making pricing more flexible.</p>\n<p>As of now, there are no plans to license the technology to other businesses, Pellicano said. However, Airbnb open-sourced the underlying technology that powers the data crunching system, so outside developers can download the software and build similar systems on top of it. Still, while the data analytic technology is powerful, it&#8217;s the data that makes things the system work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The most important component here is having Airbnb’s rich data into how our guests interact with their Airbnb listings and the overview of the markets, and that is something that is definitely internal,&#8221; said Ifrach.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n<p><em>For more on Airbnb, check out the following Fortune video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"51\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4592247319001-51\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4592247319001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1kNQcaV\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/travel_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dairbnb%2Cairbnbfightssanfrancisco%2Cbayarea%2Cbrianchesky%2Cpropf%2Cpropositionf%2Csanfrancisco%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtravel%26topic%3Dairbnb&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

In the case of AI, bigger neural networks are faster.</p>\n<p>The net result of this speed boost means that the social network could take its <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/15/facebook-ai-moments/\">uncanny facial recognition abilities</a> to your videos in addition to your photos. And because it&#8217;s contributing these designs to the Open Compute Foundation, much like it has done for its server designs and networking gear, other companies can take these designs and build their own AI hardware or even tweak the Big Sur designs to make them better.</p>\n<p>Building hardware for machine learning and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/12/chipmakers-ai/\">artificial intelligence</a> is tough.

Serkan Piantino, director of engineering at Facebook&#8217;s AI Research, said on a conference call explaining the news, that because of the enormous amount of heat and power drawn by the graphics processing chips used in building the machines, that the team that melted its first enclosure would have gotten a steak dinner. But the challenge in building the hardware wasn&#8217;t reducing the heat from the semiconductors, but rather the amount of power they consumed.</p>\n<p>Yann LeCun, the head of AI research at Facebook, said that negotiating with the data center administrators to take in the necessary power to ensure the machines got the juice they needed was a significant issue. Each box contains 8 GPUs that consume 300 watts each, which is a large power draw. However, Facebook has managed to make the power and heat of the boxes work in its own data centers, which means they should work well in other modern data center facilities.</p>\n<p>These boxes also have the advantage of being about 30% cheaper than existing hardware that is custom-built for AI. For example, a startup called Minds.ai, launched an <a href=\"http://www.datanami.com/2015/12/07/10027/\">Amazon Web Services-like neural network as a service</a> for companies that wanted to speed up their neural network training earlier this week built on custom hardware. As for newer types of machine learning such as <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/next-ai-frontier/\">deep recommendation learning or attention learning</a>, LeCun said there aren&#8217;t a lot of specific changes that are needed on the software side, so boxes like Big Sur could be used with some software modifications.</p>\n<p>It may be that in another year we&#8217;ll see that while <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-08/why-2015-was-a-breakthrough-year-in-artificial-intelligence\">2015 was a big year for advancements in artificial intelligence</a>, that it was just the start of something much bigger enabled by a new generation of powerful hardware.</p>\n<p><em>For more on AI, watch this Fortune video:</em><br />\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"6\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4587395234001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4587395234001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1RGzwPn\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dai%2Cartificialintelligence%2Cblakeirving%2Ccyphyworks%2Cdrones%2Cebay%2Cetsy%2Cgodaddy%2Cgrokker%2Chelengreiner%2Cirobot%2Ckatrinalake%2Ckristinasalen%2Clarsbjork%2Clornaborenstein%2Cnewyorkstockexchange%2Cnyse%2Cqlik%2Cquentinclark%2Crjpittman%2Csap%2Cstitchfix%2Cstitchfix%2Ctechcetera%2Ctomfarley%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechcetera&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

              "content": "<p>Simon Anderson, who has been chief executive of DreamHost for nearly five years, is stepping down.</p>\n<p>Anderson confirmed his departure—which has not yet been publicly announced—in an interview with <em>Fortune, </em>saying he is working with DreamHost&#8217;s board to ensure a smooth transition.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: A July 2011 <a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/press/dreamhost-names-simon-anderson-to-serve-as-new-ceo/\">press release</a> announcing his appointment is probably the only such document to note the recipient&#8217;s &#8220;powerful Australian accent and movie star jawline,&#8221; but I digress.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based web hosting company became a force to be reckoned with in the<a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/2014/07/16/how-dreamhost-is-reinventing-itself-with-openstack/\"> OpenStack cloud world</a>, as evidenced by its decision to back successful storage subsystem <a href=\"http://ceph.com/\">Ceph</a>. In 2012, Dreamhost launched <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2012/05/03/inktank-launches-to-change-the-face-of-open-source-storage/\">Inktank</a>, a company offering a commercially supported version of Ceph. <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2014/04/30/wow-red-hats-buying-inktank-for-its-ceph-storage-smarts/\">Red Hat</a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"RHT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/rht/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">RHT</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> bought Inktank two years later for $175 million.</p>\n<p>Anderson said the new development was an amicable parting of ways—the only major conflict he had with the company founders is that he had wanted to seek additional growth funding while they did not. Over the years Dreamhost, co-founded by Dallas Bethune, Josh Jones, Michael Rodriguez, and Sage Weil, has been largely self-funded. All of the co-founders except Jones are still affiliated with the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their right as founders to take a different view. It&#8217;s their company that they&#8217;ve built over 18 years,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>\n<p>The entrepreneur said he has few other irons in the fire. He co-founded <a href=\"http://akanda.io/\">Akanda</a>, another company dedicated to providing commercial support for open-source technology, this time Astara network virtualization.

              "content": "<p>Airbnb wants to make it easier for hosts to make as much money as possible.</p>\n<p>The online home rental startup unveiled a new tool on Thursday that makes it easier for people to automatically set the highest possible price for their home listings without turning off potential customers.</p>\n<p>The new tool, currently only available to a limited number of Airbnb users, is basically an upgrade to a <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/using-data-to-help-set-your-price/\">pricing tool</a> the company introduced in June. That tool suggested the price hosts should charge based on factors like daily demand, the location of their property, and season.</p>\n<p>But hosts had to go into their listing to change the price, potentially on a daily basis. The updated version does the job automatically for the host, which Airbnb hopes will increase adoption.</p>\n<p>That was “more work than our hosts wanted to take on,” said Airbnb product manager Carla Pellicano.</p>\n<p>Hosts that use Smart Pricing, as the new tool is called, set a range of the lowest and highest prices they want to charge. They also must disclose if they rent frequently or infrequently, which impacts the price.</p>\n<p>The technology would likely suggest <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/17/how-uber-surge-pricing-really-works/\">higher prices</a>, sometimes referred to as surge pricing, during peak periods like winter in Palm Springs, the upcoming Super Bowl near San Francisco, and ski season in the case of a mountain chalet. At the same time, it would recommend lower prices during slow periods outside the typical vacation season and when there are no big conventions in town.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make the pricing system more personalized for Airbnb hosts, explained Pellicano. But hosts can decide against changing prices up and down if they prefer not to.</p>\n<p>“There are some hosts who think, for me it is better to have a flat price, I don’t want to confuse guests,” said Pellicano.</p>\n<p>Hotels typically use economists and data scientists to set the price on their rooms based on expected demand, explained Airbnb data scientist Bar Ifrach. But because Airbnb hosts don’t have those type of data crunching resources available to them, the company built a tool to help.</p>\n<p>Airbnb, which takes a commission on each booking, stands to earn more money if hosts maximize their rent without causing high vacancies. The tool is designed to keep apartments and homes full by making pricing more flexible.</p>\n<p>As of now, there are no plans to license the technology to other businesses, Pellicano said. However, Airbnb open-sourced the underlying technology that powers the data crunching system, so outside developers can download the software and build similar systems on top of it. Still, while the data analytic technology is powerful, it&#8217;s the data that makes things the system work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The most important component here is having Airbnb’s rich data into how our guests interact with their Airbnb listings and the overview of the markets, and that is something that is definitely internal,&#8221; said Ifrach.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n<p><em>For more on Airbnb, check out the following Fortune video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4592247319001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4592247319001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1kNQcaV\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/travel_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dairbnb%2Cairbnbfightssanfrancisco%2Cbayarea%2Cbrianchesky%2Cpropf%2Cpropositionf%2Csanfrancisco%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtravel%26topic%3Dairbnb&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

The list of newly honored artists includes Steve Miller, Cheap Trick, N.W.A., Chicago, and Deep Purple.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/08/rock-roll-hall-fame-2016-nominees\" target=\"_blank\">year’s full list of nominees</a>, which was revealed in October, included Janet Jackson, The Smiths, The Cars, Chic (their 10th nomination), The J.B.’s, Chaka Khan, Los Lobos, Nine Inch Nails, The Spinners, and Yes.</p>\n<p>N.W.A. has been on the docket for three years, but this year the group’s biopic, <em>Straight Outta Compton</em>, brought them back into the national spotlight.

I think everyone now at this point, no matter how you feel about us, understands what the group actually did and what it means to modern music. I think the movie helped to get people to remember that.”</p>\n<p>Chicago won the second ever<a href=\"http://rockhall.com/voting/2016-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-vote/\" target=\"_blank\"> public fan vote</a>, and earned more than 37.7 million votes.</p>\n<p>The fresh Hall of Famers will be honored at the annual induction ceremony on April 8 at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, and HBO will film the event for future broadcast.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/17/rock-and-roll-hall-fame-2016-inductees\">This story was originally published in Entertainment Weekly</a></em></p>\n<p><em>More from Entertainment Weekly</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/16/hilary-duff-fleetwood-mac-little-lies\">Hear Hilary Duff&#8217;s cover of Fleetwood Mac&#8217;s &#8216;Little Lies&#8217;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/11/justin-bieber-one-direction-review\">From Boys to Men: EW reviews Justin Bieber and One Direction’s new albums</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/taylor-swift-2015-in-instagram\">Taylor Swift Had A Better Year Than Everyone Else</a></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"52\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4645974198001-52\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4645974198001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1Qrpov1\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbreakingnews%2Ccoldplay%2Ccoldplaybrunomarssuperbowl%2Ccoldplayhalftime%2Centertainmentnews%2Cmusicnews%2Csportsnews%2Csuperbowl%2Csuperbowl2016coldplay%2Csuperbowl50coldplay%2Csuperbowl50halftimeperformer%2Csuperbowlhalftimeperformers%2Csuperbowlnews%2Csuperbowl%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dsuperbowl&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

The funding also included existing investors Redpoint Ventures, Raine Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Liberty Media, Scripps Networks Interactive, and Tohokushinsha Film Corporation.</p>\n<p>Founded <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2013/08/15/youtube-food-network-tastemade-raises-another-10m/\">in 2012,</a> Tastemade was the brainchild of the three former employees at content farm Demand Media. The startup originally began as a YouTube network for food, travel, and cooking shows, and marketed itself as a modern-day online Food Network. But instead of established celebrity chefs, Tastemade&#8217;s talent sways younger and more hipster.</p>\n<p>In the past year, Tastemade has focused on bringing its videos to other fast-growing video platforms including Facebook, Apple TV, and Snapchat, said co-founder Larry Fitzgibbon. This year, Tastemade <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/facebook-lines-up-7-branded-content-video-partners-including-vice-disney-1201478229/\">joined</a> Facebook&#8217;s Anthology network, which matches marketers with video content creators. Tastemade was also <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/facebook-video-ad-revenue-partners-1201532366/\">chosen by Facebook</a> as an early partner to start testing ads within videos on the network. Fitzgibbon said that Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook-242/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> has been &#8220;huge&#8221; in the company&#8217;s growth over the past year, and that it will continue to develop content specifically for the social network.</p>\n<p>He added that Facebook has also been instrumental in expanding Tastemade&#8217;s viewership overseas. In Brazil, Facebook is seeing several hundred million views of Tastemade&#8217;s videos on Facebook monthly.</p>\n<p>Tastemade now reaches over 100 million monthly active viewers across its network, and is seeing over 1 billion views monthly, including views from Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube and other sites.</p>\n<p>Although Facebook video is growing fast, YouTube is still a significant part of Tastemade&#8217;s viewership, said Fitzgibbon. On YouTube, Tastemade<a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/tastemade-foodie-giants/\"> has 86 million subscribers</a> and sees 450 million views per month on the Google-owned <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"/company/goog/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> video site. As of June, Facebook was seeing 359 million monthly views on Facebook.</p>\n<p>Tastemade faces competition from Buzzfeed, which also produces food videos, female-focused media company PopSugar, and of course, the Food Network.</p>\n<p>In terms of advertising, the company <a href=\"http://fortune.com/internet-tv-video-fight/\">has also been able to</a> draw large brands, especially for sponsored content. American Express paid more than $1 million to sponsor two series created around how-to videos, recipes, and “life hacks” and Grey Goose sponsored a series about cocktails called Local Flight.</p>\n<p>The company also makes money from licensing content to TV networks, and just <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/cooking-channel-tastemade-grill-iron-tv-1201584807/\">signed a deal </a> with Scripps&#8217; Cooking Channel.</p>\n<p>Fitzgibbon declined to reveal exact revenue, but said it is doubling year over year.</p>\n<p>The new funding will be used to increase the company&#8217;s sales and advertising teams and for further expansion to international markets.

          "content": "<p>New York media executives used to feel anxiety over landing a prime lunch reservation at Michael’s in Midtown Manhattan. Now, they’re dying to get into a much more exclusive club: Snapchat Discover.<br />\nIt’s new. It’s hip with the kids. It is fast becoming a mobile media sensation, with a group of carefully selected media partners falling over themselves to <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">provide stories and videos for a new generation of consumers, all from within the Snapchat app.</span></p>\n<p>Anybody who’s anybody is there—and the nobodies who can’t get in are scrambling to change their sorry situation.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not that simple. With only 15 channels, Snapchat Discover is a platform promoting scarcity in a digital universe of limitless blog posts, cat videos, hot takes, and Tweets. When Snapchat added two new media companies to Discover in July, it kicked out two others, Yahoo and Warner Music Group. When it adds another batch in October, it may remove more.</p>\n<p>Such moves make Snapchat Discover feel like the &#8220;cool kids table&#8221; of media, which is catnip for status-obsessed media execs. &#8220;It’s the velvet rope thing where people are lining up and they don’t know what they’re lining up for. But they want to get in,&#8221; one executive said.</p>\n<p>Snapchat uses data, not perceived industry power, to determine which media companies stay and which get the boot. And it helps to know Nick Bell. As Snapchat’s head of content, Bell selects those partners, which currently include digital outlets (Vice, BuzzFeed, Mashable), magazines (<em>People</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan</em>), and television networks (CNN, Comedy Central).</p>\n<p>“It’s the hottest ticket in town,” says the CEO of one publication that recently joined Discover, speaking anonymously because the discussions with Snapchat are private. “Everyone who is not on here wants to be on here,” says another. Executives have been hounded by their counterparts at other publications wanting to know the secret to landing a coveted spot in the app. Even a spokesperson conceded that the interest has been, at times, “overwhelming.” <em>Fortune</em> spoke with executives from half of Snapchat’s current Discover partners as well as several others hoping to get in.</p>\n<p>The limited number of spots means a tiny class of media companies get real traction with Snapchat’s 100 million daily users. Within the industry, there’s a running joke that CNN’s Snapchat channel gets more views than its cable TV channel. (It may well be true—some partners report millions of views per day, which beats most cable news networks.)</p>\n<p>If the future of media is distributing content across numerous digital channels, media executives see Snapchat at the forefront, thanks to its engaged audience of young people. “If you throw mobile, video, millennials and explosive growth together, people would be crazy not to focus on it,” says an executive.</p>\n<h2>Getting in isn’t easy</h2>\n<p>The courting period lasts months and usually involves submitting numerous examples of original content to a private content management system.</p>\n<p>Bell prefers publishers that create special “vertical videos,” cropped to fit into an upright smartphone. Those videos get nine times more views than horizontally shot videos repurposed from TV and YouTube. Tastemade, a food-focused video network that joined Discover in August, even built a set at its Santa Monica studio specifically designed for vertical video.</p>\n<p>Partners need to be able to move quickly, since Snapchat, which is very much a startup despite its $15 billion valuation, can be disorganized and spontaneous. “It drives the traditional media companies a little crazy,” one executive says.</p>\n<p>Once they’re in, publishers post daily content that’s native to the strange, sometimes confusing nature of the app. That includes looped animations, quotes, quizzes, “Flashback Friday” videos and activity-book style images that users fill out and share with their friends. A tour of the channels can feel like an acid trip through the candy-colored diary of a hyperactive teenager. It takes significant resources to create those acid trips, though: Mashable has a team of eight to 10 people who create animated graphics, images and videos for its Snapchat Channel, for example.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"54\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4158756817001-54\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4158756817001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1iKiW3m\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dsnapchatbestfriends%2Csnapchatemojis%2Csnapchatlowlightfeature%2Csnapchatneedslovesection%2Csnapchatnewemojifeature%2Csnapchatnewfeature%2Csnapchatnews%2Csnapchattechcrunch%2Csnpachatfriendemoji%2Ctechnews%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dsnapchatemojis&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A push to sell ads</h2>\n<p>Ad sales have become a much bigger part of the conversation since Discover launched in January, a media executive says. Snapchat has created pressure to deliver revenue and show momentum, reportedly targeting $50 million in revenue this year, even after losing some key employees. (Mike Randall, its vice president of business and marketing partnerships, and Emily Bell, its chief operating officer, left in the last year.) “[In January] they didn’t talk about sales. Now they’re asking, ‘How many sales people do you have? Where are they?’” one executive says.</p>\n<p>For existing partners, Snapchat asks for detailed weekly sales updates about which advertisers the publisher is talking to and where the conversations stand.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its enviable young audience, brands are eager to run ads on Snapchat. “A lot of advertisers came back from [the Cannes Lions festival] saying, ‘I like Snapchat, get me into Snapchat,’” one executive said.</p>\n<p>But the company doesn’t have a large enough ad sales team to support the demand, so it’s depending on its media partners to sell. (A Snapchat spokesperson said the company has tripled its sales team over the last quarter.) Revenue share varies between publishers, but some say Snapchat takes a 30% cut of ads sold by publishers and a 50% cut of ads sold by Snapchat’s team.</p>\n<p>Many advertisers are experimenting on the platform, but waiting to get data that shows their ads are working before investing more. Further, several publishers said they view revenue from Snapchat “incremental” and not core to their operations.</p>\n<p>They may decide, after all the fuss of getting in, that it’s not worth the effort. As one executive asked: “How long will the sexiness of getting invited into the club last without any return on it?”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">Subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, <em>Fortune’s</em> daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n",

              "content": "<p>New York media executives used to feel anxiety over landing a prime lunch reservation at Michael’s in Midtown Manhattan. Now, they’re dying to get into a much more exclusive club: Snapchat Discover.<br />\nIt’s new. It’s hip with the kids. It is fast becoming a mobile media sensation, with a group of carefully selected media partners falling over themselves to <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">provide stories and videos for a new generation of consumers, all from within the Snapchat app.</span></p>\n<p>Anybody who’s anybody is there—and the nobodies who can’t get in are scrambling to change their sorry situation.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not that simple. With only 15 channels, Snapchat Discover is a platform promoting scarcity in a digital universe of limitless blog posts, cat videos, hot takes, and Tweets. When Snapchat added two new media companies to Discover in July, it kicked out two others, Yahoo and Warner Music Group. When it adds another batch in October, it may remove more.</p>\n<p>Such moves make Snapchat Discover feel like the &#8220;cool kids table&#8221; of media, which is catnip for status-obsessed media execs. &#8220;It’s the velvet rope thing where people are lining up and they don’t know what they’re lining up for. But they want to get in,&#8221; one executive said.</p>\n<p>Snapchat uses data, not perceived industry power, to determine which media companies stay and which get the boot. And it helps to know Nick Bell. As Snapchat’s head of content, Bell selects those partners, which currently include digital outlets (Vice, BuzzFeed, Mashable), magazines (<em>People</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan</em>), and television networks (CNN, Comedy Central).</p>\n<p>“It’s the hottest ticket in town,” says the CEO of one publication that recently joined Discover, speaking anonymously because the discussions with Snapchat are private. “Everyone who is not on here wants to be on here,” says another. Executives have been hounded by their counterparts at other publications wanting to know the secret to landing a coveted spot in the app. Even a spokesperson conceded that the interest has been, at times, “overwhelming.” <em>Fortune</em> spoke with executives from half of Snapchat’s current Discover partners as well as several others hoping to get in.</p>\n<p>The limited number of spots means a tiny class of media companies get real traction with Snapchat’s 100 million daily users. Within the industry, there’s a running joke that CNN’s Snapchat channel gets more views than its cable TV channel. (It may well be true—some partners report millions of views per day, which beats most cable news networks.)</p>\n<p>If the future of media is distributing content across numerous digital channels, media executives see Snapchat at the forefront, thanks to its engaged audience of young people. “If you throw mobile, video, millennials and explosive growth together, people would be crazy not to focus on it,” says an executive.</p>\n<h2>Getting in isn’t easy</h2>\n<p>The courting period lasts months and usually involves submitting numerous examples of original content to a private content management system.</p>\n<p>Bell prefers publishers that create special “vertical videos,” cropped to fit into an upright smartphone. Those videos get nine times more views than horizontally shot videos repurposed from TV and YouTube. Tastemade, a food-focused video network that joined Discover in August, even built a set at its Santa Monica studio specifically designed for vertical video.</p>\n<p>Partners need to be able to move quickly, since Snapchat, which is very much a startup despite its $15 billion valuation, can be disorganized and spontaneous. “It drives the traditional media companies a little crazy,” one executive says.</p>\n<p>Once they’re in, publishers post daily content that’s native to the strange, sometimes confusing nature of the app. That includes looped animations, quotes, quizzes, “Flashback Friday” videos and activity-book style images that users fill out and share with their friends. A tour of the channels can feel like an acid trip through the candy-colored diary of a hyperactive teenager. It takes significant resources to create those acid trips, though: Mashable has a team of eight to 10 people who create animated graphics, images and videos for its Snapchat Channel, for example.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4158756817001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4158756817001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1iKiW3m\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dsnapchatbestfriends%2Csnapchatemojis%2Csnapchatlowlightfeature%2Csnapchatneedslovesection%2Csnapchatnewemojifeature%2Csnapchatnewfeature%2Csnapchatnews%2Csnapchattechcrunch%2Csnpachatfriendemoji%2Ctechnews%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dsnapchatemojis&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A push to sell ads</h2>\n<p>Ad sales have become a much bigger part of the conversation since Discover launched in January, a media executive says. Snapchat has created pressure to deliver revenue and show momentum, reportedly targeting $50 million in revenue this year, even after losing some key employees. (Mike Randall, its vice president of business and marketing partnerships, and Emily Bell, its chief operating officer, left in the last year.) “[In January] they didn’t talk about sales. Now they’re asking, ‘How many sales people do you have? Where are they?’” one executive says.</p>\n<p>For existing partners, Snapchat asks for detailed weekly sales updates about which advertisers the publisher is talking to and where the conversations stand.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its enviable young audience, brands are eager to run ads on Snapchat. “A lot of advertisers came back from [the Cannes Lions festival] saying, ‘I like Snapchat, get me into Snapchat,’” one executive said.</p>\n<p>But the company doesn’t have a large enough ad sales team to support the demand, so it’s depending on its media partners to sell. (A Snapchat spokesperson said the company has tripled its sales team over the last quarter.) Revenue share varies between publishers, but some say Snapchat takes a 30% cut of ads sold by publishers and a 50% cut of ads sold by Snapchat’s team.</p>\n<p>Many advertisers are experimenting on the platform, but waiting to get data that shows their ads are working before investing more. Further, several publishers said they view revenue from Snapchat “incremental” and not core to their operations.</p>\n<p>They may decide, after all the fuss of getting in, that it’s not worth the effort.

      "content": "<p>Scientists are predicting that the flu season will kick into gear a little later than normal this year.</p>\n<p>A team of mathematicians and computer scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico say it&#8217;s probable that this season&#8217;s flu cases will spike in February. That&#8217;s in contrast to the past three years, when the flu peaked in mid-to-late-December.</p>\n<p>Scientist Sara Del Valle, who leads a group tracking flu cases for the federal government, said her team looks at two types of data to make their predictions: the number of &#8216;flu-like&#8217; virus symptoms being reported at doctor&#8217;s offices, and actual lab samples of the flu. (Both are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Putting the two pieces together, Del Valle&#8217;s team can get a more accurate picture of how the flu is spreading around the country.</p>\n<p>Now the team&#8217;s system is getting faster and smarter with the help of a third, and more unusual, data source: Wikipedia searches. Del Valle&#8217;s found that as the number of flu cases increase, so do searches of about a dozen &#8216;influenza&#8217;-related Wikipedia pages. And, because people search online before they ever step foot in their doctor&#8217;s office, the team thinks the addition will help them track flu patterns more quickly. Wikipedia <a href=\"https://stats.wikimedia.org/\">search data is available</a> hour by hour, as opposed to the two weeks it can take to get lab test results back from the CDC.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bsvgateway.org/flu/\">Current models</a> are also predicting this will be a mild flu year. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s time to start licking your co-worker&#8217;s coffee cup just yet. “Just because we&#8217;re predicting a mild season doesn&#8217;t mean that people shouldn&#8217;t get vaccinated,” Del Valle says. “Because you never know if you might be the one to get the flu.”</p>\n<p>The team plans to update their flu forecasts every two weeks this season, and hope to have the Wikipedia data integrated into their predictions within the month. Until then, just keep your distance, please.</p>\n<p><em>Make sure to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/\">subscribe to Data Sheet</a>, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.</em></p>\n<p><em>For more on America&#8217;s healthcare system, check out the following Fortune video:</em></p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"55\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4437089138001-55\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4437089138001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1lQBeSE\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dandrewnusca%2Cgrandrounds%2Chealthtechstartup%2Chealthcaresystemamericanhealthcaresystem%2Cmedtech%2Cowentripp%2Ctechdebate%2Ctechstartup%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

The original version can be found <a href=\"http://time.com/4090615/medication-that-makes-flu-shots-less-effective/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </em></p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">By Alice Park <a class=\"author-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/aliceparkny\" target=\"_blank\">@aliceparkny</a></p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">Every flu season, doctors repeat the same advice: Get your shot. And for certain groups, including the elderly, that recommendation is especially important—each year, nearly 3,000 people over age 65 die of the flu.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">But there is intriguing evidence that statins, the popular cholesterol-lowering drugs, may change immune responses. Now, in two papers published in the <em><a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/current\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Infectious Diseases</a></em>, researchers report that people taking statins for lengthy periods of time have a dampened response to the flu vaccine and that they are more likely to see the doctor during flu season for influenza symptoms.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">Dr. Steven Black, professor of pediatrics at the Center for Global Health at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and his colleagues, <a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/15/infdis.jiv456.full\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed data involving more than 5,000 people over age 65</a> who received one of two different forms of a flu vaccine during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 flu seasons. Because the study also asked the participants about their medications, the researchers could compare people who took statins to those who didn’t. It turns out that statin-users produced anywhere from 30% to 60% fewer antibodies to the influenza virus 22 days after getting immunized than those who didn’t take the drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">In the <a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/15/infdis.jiv457.full\" target=\"_blank\">second study</a>, Emory University’s Saad Omer and his colleagues studied rates of respiratory infection, an indication of influenza, across nine flu seasons among members of a managed care group in Georgia. When they added in information on the patients’ statin use, they found that the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing those infections was 12.6% among statin users, compared to 26.2% among those not taking the drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\"><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/3732605/statins-may-seriously-increase-diabetes-risk/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"item-title\">Statins May Seriously Increase Diabetes Risk</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">The results set the stage for a rethinking about what older patients taking statins should do about their yearly flu shots. Black says he opted for the higher dose flu vaccine this year, since he takes a statin. The higher dose shot is boosted with more influenza antigen, which is supposed to do a better job at triggering the immune system into action and create more antibodies against the flu virus. There are also vaccines that are goosed with something called adjuvant which also helps to awaken the immune system, but these are not approved yet by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, although they are available in Canada and Europe.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">What people should <em>not</em> do, say experts, is either stop taking their statins or skip the flu shot.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">“We know statins improve survival in people with [high cholesterol] and heart disease, so they should be taken,” says Dr. Robert Atmar, professor of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the studies. “We know that flu vaccines decrease the risk of influenza and complications from influenza infection and should be taken.”</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">He notes that while statins seem to decrease the response to the flu vaccine, they didn’t suppress them altogether, so even if you are taking statins, you will still get some protection from the flu vaccine. What the latest results suggest is the need for further studies to answer questions such as whether people should temporarily stop taking statins around the time they get vaccinated against the flu, or whether the higher dose vaccines, like the one Black took, can actually compensate for the muted responses to the vaccine.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"56\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4342201416001-56\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4342201416001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1SaSPio\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dfromthecorneroffice%2Cnovartis%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dfromthecorneroffice&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

          "content": "<p>With flu season upon us, your employer may be offering free shots and sending out mass emails reminding everyone not to spread their germs around at work.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s nice, but an unscientific <em>Fortune</em> poll of managers at a couple dozen big companies turned up no one — <em>no one</em> — who has figured out an effective way to make cold-and-flu sufferers stay home.</p>\n<p>“There would have to be consequences, like docking someone a vacation day for every day they show up sick,” said one boss who asked for anonymity, hastening to add, “Of course, we don’t do that.”</p>\n<p>So, even though 88% of workers say they encourage ailing colleagues to keep away, about 60% admit they personally still come in to the office, according to a new survey of 1,500 mostly-white-collar employees by Staples Advantage. The biggest reason, cited by 58%, is that there “is too much going on at work to take a sick day.” That’s a big jump from the 30% minority who said the same in 2012.</p>\n<p>The problem is most acute among leaders who, in theory at least, are supposed to be setting an example for the troops. One in three managers say they feel pressure from higher-ups to come in whether they’re ill or not, compared to only 19% of non-managers. Moreover, 40% of bosses think that showing up no matter how awful they feel “shows extra initiative,” versus only about a quarter of employees who think so.</p>\n<p>One thing that’s a little weird here is that most people suspect such heroics are wasted. Two-thirds (66%) of all employees surveyed, including managers, say that presenteeism — that is, sitting at one’s desk but feeling too rotten to get much done — is “worse for a business” than not coming in at all. That’s a lot more than last year, when only 31% agreed. Yet the allure of face time (and not via Skype) persists.</p>\n<p>Some employees with contagious conditions, including a disquieting number in the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/20/food-industry-workers-sick/\">food industry</a>, report for work anyway because they need the money. Almost half (48%) in a CareerBuilder poll of more than 5,000 full-time workers say they can’t afford to miss even one day’s pay — up from 38% who said the same thing last year.</p>\n<p>The study notes that this varies greatly by age. Nearly three-quarters (71%) of workers ages 18 to 24 say they come to work sick for financial reasons, versus 44% of employees ages 35 to 44, and 32% who are 55 or older.</p>\n",

Walgreen has also administered 13.4% more flu vaccines this season, a total of 7.5 million doses.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is facing a miserable flu season, which has already been declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control. This year&#8217;s vaccine is a relatively poor match to the virus that is currently circulating around the nation. That&#8217;s contributing to the large number of reported cases, many of which were severe enough to require hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Forty-three states are recording high numbers of flu infections, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/flu-activity-expands.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the CDC said</a>. Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi are the three hardest hit states, respectively, based on the <a href=\"http://news.walgreens.com/press-releases/general-news/walgreens-flu-index-jan-5.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Walgreens Flu Index</a> for the week of Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s bad news for those of us looking to stay healthy during the flu season, which typically peaks in February. But it&#8217;s helped the bottom line for drug stores like Walgreen, which provide both the vaccines to prevent the virus as well as the drugs to treat it. Many people may have to go in for both such items given the poorly-matching vaccine this year. The CDC encourages people to get the flu vaccine and &#8220;prompt treatment&#8221; with antiviral prescriptions if infected.</p>\n<p>More people walking into Walgreen stores is also good news for front-of-store sales, items like greeting cards, tissues and cough drops. Total front-end sales increased 3.5% in December compared a year earlier, and customer traffic in comparable stores was up 0.3% over the same period.</p>\n<p>Other drug stores may also be benefitting from the harsh flu season. CVS Health <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CVS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/cvs-health-10/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CVS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, which reports its updated sales numbers in its quarterly report on Feb. 10, said that flu vaccinations were up by about 8% this season. CVS, unlike its peers, doesn&#8217;t disclose monthly sales trends.</p>\n<p>Rite Aid <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"RAD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/rite-aid-117/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">RAD</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span>, which has distributed more than 3 million flu vaccines this season, reported December same-store sales <a href=\"https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news?p_p_id=riteaidpressreleases_WAR_riteaidpressreleasesportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-3&amp;p_p_col_pos=2&amp;p_p_col_count=3&amp;_riteaidpressreleases_WAR_riteaidpressreleasesportlet_action=getNewsRoomDetail&amp;itemNumber=1830\" target=\"_blank\">leapt 5.3%</a>.

The original version can be found <a href=\"http://time.com/4090615/medication-that-makes-flu-shots-less-effective/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </em></p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">By Alice Park <a class=\"author-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/aliceparkny\" target=\"_blank\">@aliceparkny</a></p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">Every flu season, doctors repeat the same advice: Get your shot. And for certain groups, including the elderly, that recommendation is especially important—each year, nearly 3,000 people over age 65 die of the flu.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">But there is intriguing evidence that statins, the popular cholesterol-lowering drugs, may change immune responses. Now, in two papers published in the <em><a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/current\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Infectious Diseases</a></em>, researchers report that people taking statins for lengthy periods of time have a dampened response to the flu vaccine and that they are more likely to see the doctor during flu season for influenza symptoms.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">Dr. Steven Black, professor of pediatrics at the Center for Global Health at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and his colleagues, <a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/15/infdis.jiv456.full\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed data involving more than 5,000 people over age 65</a> who received one of two different forms of a flu vaccine during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 flu seasons. Because the study also asked the participants about their medications, the researchers could compare people who took statins to those who didn’t. It turns out that statin-users produced anywhere from 30% to 60% fewer antibodies to the influenza virus 22 days after getting immunized than those who didn’t take the drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">In the <a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/15/infdis.jiv457.full\" target=\"_blank\">second study</a>, Emory University’s Saad Omer and his colleagues studied rates of respiratory infection, an indication of influenza, across nine flu seasons among members of a managed care group in Georgia. When they added in information on the patients’ statin use, they found that the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing those infections was 12.6% among statin users, compared to 26.2% among those not taking the drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\"><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"http://time.com/3732605/statins-may-seriously-increase-diabetes-risk/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"item-title\">Statins May Seriously Increase Diabetes Risk</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">The results set the stage for a rethinking about what older patients taking statins should do about their yearly flu shots. Black says he opted for the higher dose flu vaccine this year, since he takes a statin. The higher dose shot is boosted with more influenza antigen, which is supposed to do a better job at triggering the immune system into action and create more antibodies against the flu virus. There are also vaccines that are goosed with something called adjuvant which also helps to awaken the immune system, but these are not approved yet by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, although they are available in Canada and Europe.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">What people should <em>not</em> do, say experts, is either stop taking their statins or skip the flu shot.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">“We know statins improve survival in people with [high cholesterol] and heart disease, so they should be taken,” says Dr. Robert Atmar, professor of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the studies. “We know that flu vaccines decrease the risk of influenza and complications from influenza infection and should be taken.”</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\">He notes that while statins seem to decrease the response to the flu vaccine, they didn’t suppress them altogether, so even if you are taking statins, you will still get some protection from the flu vaccine. What the latest results suggest is the need for further studies to answer questions such as whether people should temporarily stop taking statins around the time they get vaccinated against the flu, or whether the higher dose vaccines, like the one Black took, can actually compensate for the muted responses to the vaccine.</p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"12\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4342201416001-12\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4342201416001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1SaSPio\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dfromthecorneroffice%2Cnovartis%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dfromthecorneroffice&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

              "content": "<p>With flu season upon us, your employer may be offering free shots and sending out mass emails reminding everyone not to spread their germs around at work.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s nice, but an unscientific <em>Fortune</em> poll of managers at a couple dozen big companies turned up no one — <em>no one</em> — who has figured out an effective way to make cold-and-flu sufferers stay home.</p>\n<p>“There would have to be consequences, like docking someone a vacation day for every day they show up sick,” said one boss who asked for anonymity, hastening to add, “Of course, we don’t do that.”</p>\n<p>So, even though 88% of workers say they encourage ailing colleagues to keep away, about 60% admit they personally still come in to the office, according to a new survey of 1,500 mostly-white-collar employees by Staples Advantage. The biggest reason, cited by 58%, is that there “is too much going on at work to take a sick day.” That’s a big jump from the 30% minority who said the same in 2012.</p>\n<p>The problem is most acute among leaders who, in theory at least, are supposed to be setting an example for the troops. One in three managers say they feel pressure from higher-ups to come in whether they’re ill or not, compared to only 19% of non-managers. Moreover, 40% of bosses think that showing up no matter how awful they feel “shows extra initiative,” versus only about a quarter of employees who think so.</p>\n<p>One thing that’s a little weird here is that most people suspect such heroics are wasted. Two-thirds (66%) of all employees surveyed, including managers, say that presenteeism — that is, sitting at one’s desk but feeling too rotten to get much done — is “worse for a business” than not coming in at all. That’s a lot more than last year, when only 31% agreed. Yet the allure of face time (and not via Skype) persists.</p>\n<p>Some employees with contagious conditions, including a disquieting number in the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/20/food-industry-workers-sick/\">food industry</a>, report for work anyway because they need the money. Almost half (48%) in a CareerBuilder poll of more than 5,000 full-time workers say they can’t afford to miss even one day’s pay — up from 38% who said the same thing last year.</p>\n<p>The study notes that this varies greatly by age. Nearly three-quarters (71%) of workers ages 18 to 24 say they come to work sick for financial reasons, versus 44% of employees ages 35 to 44, and 32% who are 55 or older.</p>\n",

Walgreen has also administered 13.4% more flu vaccines this season, a total of 7.5 million doses.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is facing a miserable flu season, which has already been declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control. This year&#8217;s vaccine is a relatively poor match to the virus that is currently circulating around the nation. That&#8217;s contributing to the large number of reported cases, many of which were severe enough to require hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Forty-three states are recording high numbers of flu infections, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/flu-activity-expands.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the CDC said</a>. Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi are the three hardest hit states, respectively, based on the <a href=\"http://news.walgreens.com/press-releases/general-news/walgreens-flu-index-jan-5.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Walgreens Flu Index</a> for the week of Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s bad news for those of us looking to stay healthy during the flu season, which typically peaks in February. But it&#8217;s helped the bottom line for drug stores like Walgreen, which provide both the vaccines to prevent the virus as well as the drugs to treat it. Many people may have to go in for both such items given the poorly-matching vaccine this year. The CDC encourages people to get the flu vaccine and &#8220;prompt treatment&#8221; with antiviral prescriptions if infected.</p>\n<p>More people walking into Walgreen stores is also good news for front-of-store sales, items like greeting cards, tissues and cough drops.

          "content": "<p>Congressional leaders nixed a bipartisan effort to overhaul investor visas in a win for developers of projects in Manhattan and other cities around the country.</p>\n<p>The EB-5 visa allows foreigners to get a green card in return for a $500,000 investment toward the creation of American jobs. The program has become very popular in recent years, as developers tapped it for billions of dollars in cheap financing for their projects. It has also resulted in high-profile cases of fraud. (<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/07/24/immigration-eb-5-visa-for-sale/\">Read last year’s <em>Fortune</em> feature on the issue</a>.)</p>\n<p>Congressional aides said Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Republican John Cornyn of Texas were among the lawmakers who put the brakes on the plan to overhaul the program, which will now continue unchanged through September 2016.</p>\n<p>The EB-5 program was created to boost investment and jobs in impoverished areas, but it has come under criticism for its use in mega-projects in Manhattan and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“I care about creating jobs and attracting investment in rural communities like Vermont and distressed areas,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, in a statement to <em>Fortune</em>. He co-authored an overhaul bill with Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, House Judiciary Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.</p>\n<p>“We pushed aggressively for its inclusion in the omnibus appropriations bill but congressional leadership inexcusably rejected this much-needed reform,” he said. Leahy said he hopes the spending bill will get a markup in January.</p>\n<p>The overhaul would have increased the minimum investment to $800,000 per person in priority areas to qualify for a green card. It also would have reserved 4,000 of the 10,000 visa slots for rural and impoverished urban areas, and it would have required more oversight of projects to protect against fraud.</p>\n<p>Invest in the USA, an industry group, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights had separately endorsed the reform legislation.</p>\n",

          "content": "<p>By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell</p>\n<p>WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) &#8211; A sprawling deal to keep the U.S. government operating through next September met resistance on Wednesday from conservative Republicans and the House Democratic leader, who called proposed tax breaks a &#8220;massive giveaway&#8221; to special interests.</p>\n<p>The deal, which would also put an end to a 40-year-old ban on oil exports, was tentatively embraced by negotiators late on Tuesday. It includes a $1.15-trillion U.S. government spending bill and a companion $650 billion package of tax breaks.</p>\n<p>House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he was confident of a bipartisan compromise and that there is &#8220;no reason to believe we&#8217;re going to have a shutdown&#8221; of the federal government.</p>\n<p>The deal is due to be voted on later this week in the Republican-controlled House and Senate.</p>\n<p>Some Republican fiscal hawks balked at the funding bill, raising questions about the support for it in the House, though it was unclear whether conservatives had the votes or the inclination to push the country to a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>Representative Jim Jordan told Reuters he believed the so-called Freedom Caucus and other conservative Republicans would vote against the &#8220;omnibus&#8221; spending bill because it failed to include provisions to tighten U.S. screening of Syrian refugees, address national security concerns and deny funding to Planned Parenthood, a target of abortion rights opponents.</p>\n<p>It also contained too many concessions to Democrats, he said. &#8220;The omnibus I think has real problems, not just with Freedom Caucus members, but with lots of Republicans,&#8221; Jordan said after meeting with colleagues.</p>\n<p>Representative Tim Huelskamp, a frequent critic of past Republican fiscal measures, also objected to the Planned Parenthood omission and said the legislation includes nothing to stop President Barack Obama&#8217;s program to bring thousands of Syrian refugees to the United States.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I see it (the bill) now, no, I&#8217;m not planning on supporting it,&#8221; Huelskamp told reporters late on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also cited concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Republicans&#8217; tax extender bill provides hundreds of billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks that are permanent and unpaid for,&#8221; Pelosi said in a statement. &#8220;These massive giveaways to the special interests and big corporations are deeply destructive to our future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In return for a repeal of the oil export ban, Democrats won temporary tax breaks to boost wind and solar development, Representative Ann Wagner said. These are important priorities for Obama after a Paris climate change deal that calls for significant global reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>\n<p>Other elements of the two bills that are expected to move through Congress in coming days, according to Republican lawmakers, include:</p>\n<p>&#8211; A $650-billion package extending a package of tax breaks over 10 years, with $560 billion of the total in permanent extensions, including for business research and development.</p>\n<p>Many Democrats were expected to oppose this measure, saying it costs too much and is too heavily skewed toward corporate interests. But it does include a provision Democrats sought, making a child tax credit permanent.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Changes to a visa waiver program that will tighten travel curbs on those who have been in Iraq and Syria;</p>\n<p>&#8211; No &#8220;bailout&#8221; for Puerto Rico, which is experiencing fiscal difficulties;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Provisions to encourage companies to share cyber data with the U.S. government in its fight against hackers;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The &#8220;179&#8221; deduction, a tax break small business owners use to buy new equipment, is being made permanent;</p>\n<p>&#8211; A two-year delay in a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices and a &#8220;Cadillac tax&#8221; on high-cost healthcare plans. Representative Tom Cole said the tax package also would include a one-year delay in a tax on health insurance providers.</p>\n<p>He said it also extends for another year a provision limiting how much the government can spend on &#8220;risk corridors&#8221; protecting insurers against financial losses under Obama&#8217;s landmark healthcare law;</p>\n<p>&#8211; A five-year renewal of a program to help first responders and others who suffered illness from exposure to toxins at the World Trade Center site destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.</p>\n<p>Before Congress debates these long-term bills, it is expected on Wednesday to pass another stop-gap funding bill giving lawmakers until Dec. 22 to complete their work. Without the temporary measure, federal funding for a range of government programs expires at midnight on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>A congressional aide said negotiators were likely to block a proposal to revise certain legal protections for bondholders, a provision that had been pushed by Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, partly to ease the bankruptcy of casino giant Caesars Entertainment&#8217;s operating unit.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by Susan Cornwell, Doina Chiacu, David Lawder and Richard Cowan; Editing by Alistair Bell)</p>\n",

The ban expires next September. And SEC Chairman Mary Jo White has made clear she won’t push to advance the transparency rule, rendering the debate over it largely moot until a new president appoints her successor.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, groups agitating for transparency can continue pressuring holdout companies to adopt better disclosure practices voluntarily. That effort has already yielded considerable success, with more than 300 of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 now regularly reporting at least some of their political expenditures and 125 of them restricting payments to tax-exempt groups that don’t disclose their own donors.</p>\n<p>“We’re making progress getting companies to adopt this voluntarily,” said Bruce Freed, founder of the Center for Political Accountability, which has driven the debate over the disclosures. “But we need uniformity.”</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>Congressional leaders nixed a bipartisan effort to overhaul investor visas in a win for developers of projects in Manhattan and other cities around the country.</p>\n<p>The EB-5 visa allows foreigners to get a green card in return for a $500,000 investment toward the creation of American jobs. The program has become very popular in recent years, as developers tapped it for billions of dollars in cheap financing for their projects. It has also resulted in high-profile cases of fraud. (<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/07/24/immigration-eb-5-visa-for-sale/\">Read last year’s <em>Fortune</em> feature on the issue</a>.)</p>\n<p>Congressional aides said Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Republican John Cornyn of Texas were among the lawmakers who put the brakes on the plan to overhaul the program, which will now continue unchanged through September 2016.</p>\n<p>The EB-5 program was created to boost investment and jobs in impoverished areas, but it has come under criticism for its use in mega-projects in Manhattan and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“I care about creating jobs and attracting investment in rural communities like Vermont and distressed areas,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, in a statement to <em>Fortune</em>. He co-authored an overhaul bill with Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, House Judiciary Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.</p>\n<p>“We pushed aggressively for its inclusion in the omnibus appropriations bill but congressional leadership inexcusably rejected this much-needed reform,” he said. Leahy said he hopes the spending bill will get a markup in January.</p>\n<p>The overhaul would have increased the minimum investment to $800,000 per person in priority areas to qualify for a green card. It also would have reserved 4,000 of the 10,000 visa slots for rural and impoverished urban areas, and it would have required more oversight of projects to protect against fraud.</p>\n<p>Invest in the USA, an industry group, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights had separately endorsed the reform legislation.</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell</p>\n<p>WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) &#8211; A sprawling deal to keep the U.S. government operating through next September met resistance on Wednesday from conservative Republicans and the House Democratic leader, who called proposed tax breaks a &#8220;massive giveaway&#8221; to special interests.</p>\n<p>The deal, which would also put an end to a 40-year-old ban on oil exports, was tentatively embraced by negotiators late on Tuesday. It includes a $1.15-trillion U.S. government spending bill and a companion $650 billion package of tax breaks.</p>\n<p>House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he was confident of a bipartisan compromise and that there is &#8220;no reason to believe we&#8217;re going to have a shutdown&#8221; of the federal government.</p>\n<p>The deal is due to be voted on later this week in the Republican-controlled House and Senate.</p>\n<p>Some Republican fiscal hawks balked at the funding bill, raising questions about the support for it in the House, though it was unclear whether conservatives had the votes or the inclination to push the country to a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>Representative Jim Jordan told Reuters he believed the so-called Freedom Caucus and other conservative Republicans would vote against the &#8220;omnibus&#8221; spending bill because it failed to include provisions to tighten U.S. screening of Syrian refugees, address national security concerns and deny funding to Planned Parenthood, a target of abortion rights opponents.</p>\n<p>It also contained too many concessions to Democrats, he said. &#8220;The omnibus I think has real problems, not just with Freedom Caucus members, but with lots of Republicans,&#8221; Jordan said after meeting with colleagues.</p>\n<p>Representative Tim Huelskamp, a frequent critic of past Republican fiscal measures, also objected to the Planned Parenthood omission and said the legislation includes nothing to stop President Barack Obama&#8217;s program to bring thousands of Syrian refugees to the United States.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I see it (the bill) now, no, I&#8217;m not planning on supporting it,&#8221; Huelskamp told reporters late on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also cited concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Republicans&#8217; tax extender bill provides hundreds of billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks that are permanent and unpaid for,&#8221; Pelosi said in a statement. &#8220;These massive giveaways to the special interests and big corporations are deeply destructive to our future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In return for a repeal of the oil export ban, Democrats won temporary tax breaks to boost wind and solar development, Representative Ann Wagner said. These are important priorities for Obama after a Paris climate change deal that calls for significant global reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>\n<p>Other elements of the two bills that are expected to move through Congress in coming days, according to Republican lawmakers, include:</p>\n<p>&#8211; A $650-billion package extending a package of tax breaks over 10 years, with $560 billion of the total in permanent extensions, including for business research and development.</p>\n<p>Many Democrats were expected to oppose this measure, saying it costs too much and is too heavily skewed toward corporate interests. But it does include a provision Democrats sought, making a child tax credit permanent.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Changes to a visa waiver program that will tighten travel curbs on those who have been in Iraq and Syria;</p>\n<p>&#8211; No &#8220;bailout&#8221; for Puerto Rico, which is experiencing fiscal difficulties;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Provisions to encourage companies to share cyber data with the U.S. government in its fight against hackers;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The &#8220;179&#8221; deduction, a tax break small business owners use to buy new equipment, is being made permanent;</p>\n<p>&#8211; A two-year delay in a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices and a &#8220;Cadillac tax&#8221; on high-cost healthcare plans. Representative Tom Cole said the tax package also would include a one-year delay in a tax on health insurance providers.</p>\n<p>He said it also extends for another year a provision limiting how much the government can spend on &#8220;risk corridors&#8221; protecting insurers against financial losses under Obama&#8217;s landmark healthcare law;</p>\n<p>&#8211; A five-year renewal of a program to help first responders and others who suffered illness from exposure to toxins at the World Trade Center site destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.</p>\n<p>Before Congress debates these long-term bills, it is expected on Wednesday to pass another stop-gap funding bill giving lawmakers until Dec. 22 to complete their work. Without the temporary measure, federal funding for a range of government programs expires at midnight on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>A congressional aide said negotiators were likely to block a proposal to revise certain legal protections for bondholders, a provision that had been pushed by Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, partly to ease the bankruptcy of casino giant Caesars Entertainment&#8217;s operating unit.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by Susan Cornwell, Doina Chiacu, David Lawder and Richard Cowan; Editing by Alistair Bell)</p>\n",

      "title": "Putin Heaps Praise on Trump, Scorn on Erdogan",
      "content": "<p>Donald Trump got his most prominent endorsement yet Thursday&#8211;albeit not from a source anywhere near American mainstream opinion.</p>\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin positively ladled out the praise on the GOP front-runner Donald Trump at his annual set-piece press conference, calling him &#8220;an exceptionally bright personality,&#8221; and &#8220;talented, without any doubt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not our job to judge his merits, that&#8217;s for the voters of the U.S.A.,&#8221; the Kremlin leader added with his customary grace, &#8220;but he&#8217;s absolutely the leader of the presidential race.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The endorsement could be a mixed blessing, at best, for Trump. At face value, it validates his boast that he will stand up to Putin and other foreign leaders. On the other, in the context of a U.S.-Russian relationship that is more often than not confrontational, it&#8217;s not hard to see how Putin wouldn&#8217;t prefer dealing with the diplomatically erratic and inexperienced Trump than with his most likely rival, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>And in any case, Putin&#8217;s judgment calls aren&#8217;t always, how shall we say it? mainstream. Earlier in the same press conference, he repeated his call for disgraced FIFA boss Sepp Blatter to be given the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>\n<p>The Russian president had very different words for more serious foes Thursday, accusing Turkey&#8217;s leadership of &#8220;licking the Americans in a particular place,&#8221; when it ordered its air force <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/24/turkey-shot-down-russian-warplane-after-alleged-airspace-violation/\" target=\"_blank\">to shoot down a Russian bomber en route to attack rebels in Syria</a> last month. He added scornfully that the Turks had gotten little from the U.S. and its NATO allies in response.</p>\n<p>The incident was the first in which a NATO country had shot down one of Moscow&#8217;s airplanes since the alliance was founded, reviving old rivalries and causing a furious row that has hampered the quest for a common strategy to defeat the so-called Islamic State.</p>\n<p>Putin&#8217;s descent into thinly-veiled vulgarity, which elicited a big laugh from the nearly 1,400 (mostly Russian) journalists present, is an indication of how far relations with Erdogan have been strained by the shooting down. The Kremlin boss routinely does it when it comes to talking about those he despises most (but never about the U.S.). Putin once threatened to cut the penis off a French reporter who pressed him about rights abuses by his troops in the rebel region of Chechnya, and promised to bomb the same rebels &#8216;in the outhouse&#8217; if that was what it took to destroy them.</p>\n<p>Russia&#8217;s response to the Turkish incident has been <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/27/russia-turns-the-economic-thumbscrew-on-turkey/\" target=\"_blank\">swift and harsh</a>: it has imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Turkish imports, notably on fruit and vegetables, scrapped the two countries&#8217; bilateral deal on visa-free travel and effectively stopped the flow of Russian tourists to Turkey. In all, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimates the measures could cost the Turkish economy around $9 billion next year, or up to 0.7% of gross domestic product.</p>\n<p>In addition to the economic measures, Putin has deployed Russia&#8217;s most sophisticated anti-aircraft systems to Syria, ending what little hope NATO had of imposing a no-fly zone on the forces of President Bashar-al-Assad.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Did they think we&#8217;d run away? We&#8217;re not that type of people,&#8221; Putin said.</p>\n<p>Putin said Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern, secular Turkish state, would be &#8220;spinning in his grave&#8221; at the &#8216;creeping Islamization&#8217; of the country under Erdogan. And he drew a menacing parallel between the U.S.&#8217;s support for Turkey and its support for the Afghan Mujahideen in the 1980s, which morphed into the Taliban.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They may think &#8216;well, they&#8217;re Islamists, but they&#8217;re Our Islamists&#8217;,&#8221; Putin said, warning that, last time, &#8220;nothing good came of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But there were also more conciliatory moments. Putin suggested he wouldn&#8217;t want to keep a permanent military presence in Syria when the current civil war ends, hinting that the financial cost of running a permanent base could be too high for comfort against the background of Russia&#8217;s economic problems.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"60\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4596786728001-60\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4596786728001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1O8CQ02\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/international_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dformerussecretaryofdefense%2Cleonpanetta%2Cputin%2Crussia%2Cusrussianrelations%2Cvladimirputin%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dinternational%26topic%3Dleonpanetta&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n",

          "content": "<p>Hello friends and <em>Fortune</em> readers.</p>\n<p>Wall Street stock futures are higher as the world reacts positively to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s first interest rate hike in nine years (more below). The dollar is lower against the euro as traders &#8216;sell the fact&#8217; after &#8216;buying the rumor&#8217;, but stronger against the Chinese yuan.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/16/sheldon-adelson-bought-the-las-vegas-review-tribune/\" target=\"_blank\">must-read story</a> is from <em>Fortune</em>&#8216;s Dan Primack, who was first to report that billionaire casino owner and Republican party donor Sheldon Adelson is the mystery buyer of <em>The Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>. The identity of the buyer who paid $140 million for Nevada&#8217;s largest daily newspaper had been unclear for nearly a week.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what else you need to know today.</p>\n<p><strong>1. A frictionless lift-off</strong></p>\n<p>Stock markets have risen around the world in relief at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates. Markets have been happy to take at face value Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen&#8217;s interpretation of the hike as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy. The Fed assured investors that the central bank&#8217;s policy would remain accommodating as it raised rates from their longstanding stimulus level of near zero to 0.25%. Tokyo and Shanghai both rose more than 1.5%, while in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 was up nearly 3%. Commodity prices have suffered again, though, with gold approaching a 6-year low at $1,065/oz and crude oil back below $36 a barrel.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Putin admits to &#8216;military advisers&#8217; in Ukraine</strong></p>\n<p>President Vladimir Putin admitted for the first time that rebels in eastern Ukraine are being &#8216;advised&#8217; by Russians, something established beyond reasonable doubt a long time ago, but putting the seal on another 6-month extension of European sanctions against the country. Putin said the worst of Russia&#8217;s economic crisis is behind it but warned that there would probably be further budget cuts next year because the government&#8217;s oil price forecast, at $50 a barrel, is too high.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Rite Aid&#8217;s Q3 earnings</strong></p>\n<p>The drugstore operator reports third-quarter results after cutting its full-year earnings and sales forecasts earlier this year due to lower pharmacy reimbursements and expenses from its acquisition of EnvisionRx. Rite Aid <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"RAD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/rite-aid-117/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">RAD</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/27/walgreens-rite-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">agreed to be sold</a> to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"WBA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/walgreens-35/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">WBA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> for $9.4 billion in October and investors will be interested to hear updates on that deal, which likely faces a long road to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/05/walgreens-rite-aid-store-closings/\" target=\"_blank\">obtaining antitrust approval</a> as it would combine two of the country&#8217;s largest drugstore operators.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Weekly jobless claims</strong></p>\n<p>The Labor Department will release data on the number of Americans who submitted new applications for unemployment benefits last week. Weekly jobless claims are expected to have dipped to 275,000 last week, from 282,000 during the previous week. The steadily improving labor market has kept the number of weekly applications near historic lows for months.</p>\n<p><strong>5. <em>Star Wars</em> preview screenings</strong></p>\n<p>The most highly-anticipated film of the year officially opens nationwide on Friday, but <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> will first debut in various theaters across the country in special preview screenings. Fans with tickets to the advance screenings will get an early look at a movie that could become <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/just-how-much-will-the-new-star-wars-movie-make/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the highest-grossing films of all time</a>, according to several analyst predictions.

Sen. John McCain—one of the chief proponents of that ban—isn’t buying it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sen. McCain sent Defense Secretary Ash Carter a characteristically tersely-worded <a href=\"http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=417adfae-7803-4a04-b02c-e007bf0239f5\">letter</a> yesterday that accused the joint venture of manufacturing reasons for why it couldn&#8217;t compete for the launch. He described it as an effort to compel Congress to lift the ban on Russian engines. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McCain asked the Defense Department to halt regular subsidy payments made to the company to offset maintenance and infrastructure costs pending a review of its cost accounting systems. He also wants officials to evaluate the various assertions made by the partnership, known as United Launch Alliance (ULA), which </span><span class=\"s1\">until recently owned a monopoly on all Pentagon space launches.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“These assertions have major implications for both the DoD and the Congress, especially the clearly-established legislative priority to eliminate the DoD’s reliance on Russian-made rocket engines and whether the DoD should continue paying ULA a nearly $1 billion annual subsidy whether it actually launches satellites under the program or even chooses to compete for those launches,” McCain writes in the letter.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A quick backgrounder: Until Elon Musk’s SpaceX was certified to launch national security missions aboard its Falcon 9 rocket earlier this year, ULA was the Pentagon’s sole source of space launch services for national security satellites. ULA’s workhorse rocket, the Atlas V, requires a Russian-made engine known as the RD-180 to power its first stage. When Russia annexed Crimea in March of last year, Congress leveled a slew of economic sanctions against Russia, among them a ban on the import of Russian rocket engines for national security-related launches (commercial and scientific missions do not fall under the ban).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The ban exempted five RD-180 engines that were already on-order and paid for at the time the ban went into effect, offering ULA some flexibility in its launch manifest. But a home-grown RD-180 replacement engine sought by the U.S. Air Force won’t be ready until 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, ULA is more or less grounded without more RD-180s to power its Atlas V rockets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These circumstances have coalesced around ULA at a time when the Air Force has been trying to cultivate an expanded industrial base for space launch services. More competitors bidding on its launch contracts will drive down the cost of launch, the reasoning goes. It would also provide an important redundancy should technical issues or some other unforeseen event ground one of its launch partners.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By declining to bid on the launch–the first for which rival SpaceX was eligible to compete–ULA effectively cedes the contract to SpaceX, now the only company bidding for the business (the Air Force will formally award the contract early next year). Two factors drove the company&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the competition, according to ULA representatives. First, the company doesn&#8217;t have the correct contract accounting mechanisms in place to complete a compliant bid under the Air Force&#8217;s competitive bidding process. But the larger reason, company execs say, is that the company&#8217;s remaining stock of RD-180 engines has already been committed to other missions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his letter, McCain takes issue with both assertions, variously referring to them as “specious,” “dubious,” and &#8220;manufactured.&#8221; The Senator suggests that by declining to bid on the launch ULA is intentionally thwarting efforts to create competition in the launch market. The idea, McCain suggests, is to compel Congress to ease its sanctions and let ULA purchase the Russian rocket engines it wants.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“ULA’s use of these tactics is unacceptable,” McCain writes. “It artificially created a need for relief from legislative restrictions on its ability to continue using RD-180.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McCain’s major beef with ULA centers on its assigning of some of its remaining RD-180s to commercial missions not impacted by the ban. “Instead of setting those engines aside for national security launches, ULA rushed to assign them to non-national security launches that are unrestricted in their use of Russian engines,” McCain writes. “Put simply, there was no compelling reason to re-purpose DoD engines other than to attempt to compel Congress to award the Russian military-industrial base by easing sanctions targeted at Vladimir Putin and his cronies.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A letter is only a letter, but one from the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee could make a tangible impact on ULA. From the Defense Secretary, McCain wants an explanation—“with reference to source contractual documents”—as to when exactly ULA began assigning those Russian engines away from national security missions, and whether it was necessary to do so. He also wants an audit of ULA’s contractual accounting practices, and wants to withhold additional subsidy payments to the company—which stack up to nearly $1 billion annually—until he gets it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">ULA declined to comment for this story. The Defense Department did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more on the commercial space launch industry, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"61\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4372811996001-61\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4372811996001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1XX8N6f\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcommerciallaunches%2Ccommercialrockets%2Ccommercialspaceflight%2Ccommercialspaceflightcompetition%2Ccommercialspaceflightmarket%2Cspaceflight%2Cspacex%2Cspacexlaunches%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dspacex&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

          "title": "Putin's Nemesis Returns to Politics, Urging Russian Revolution",
          "content": "<p>Vladimir Putin&#8217;s biggest foe is returning to politics, saying that revolution in Russia is inevitable&#8211; and that he&#8217;s going to help bring it about.</p>\n<p>Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who served 10 years in prison after losing a titanic power struggle with Putin in 2003, told a conference in London Wednesday that the overthrow of Putin&#8217;s government is &#8220;inevitable and necessary&#8221; and that &#8220;I will certainly do my best to ensure that the rule of law is restored through a revolution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His words amount to a tearing-up of the peace deal he made with Putin when the latter pardoned him on the eve of the Sochi Winter Olympics. Khodorkovsky has been living in exile in the Netherlands since then. His comments appear to be a response Russian prosecutors, who summonsed him this week for questioning about the murder, in 1998, of a Siberian mayor who had accused his company of avoiding taxes. Khodorkovsky&#8217;s former security chief was convicted of that killing in 2007. Khodorkovsky has always denied ordering it.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s, Khodorkovsky had grabbed some of the juiciest bits of the Soviet Union&#8217;s oil sector and bundled them into what was at one time one of the world&#8217;s largest private oil companies, Yukos, ruthlessly abusing fellow-shareholders in the process. When he orchestrated opposition in parliament to Putin&#8217;s plans to squeeze more taxes out of the oil sector, he was arrested and convicted of embezzlement and tax evasion in a trial condemned internationally as rigged. Yukos was gobbled up by Rosneft, a state-controlled company embodying Putin&#8217;s strategy of bringing &#8216;strategic assets&#8217; back under state control after a corrupt privatization process in the 1990s (now 19.75% owned by BP Plc).</p>\n<p>The crushing of Khodorkovsky, which tamed the rest of his generation of oligarchs, was the defining moment in Putin&#8217;s ascendancy: a moment when the Russian state reasserted itself after a decade of chaos, to huge popular approval. Critics say instead of reducing corruption, it merely ushered in a new corrupt elite, one that has become bolder and more predatory as the easy flow of petrodollars has dried up.</p>\n<p>Khodorkovsky still faces huge obstacles to having an impact on his homeland (not least the vast disparity in resources between him and Putin&#8217;s regime). Opinion polls suggest a clear majority of Russians support &#8216;the good Tsar&#8217; Putin. <a href=\"http://www.levada.ru/eng/\" target=\"_blank\">Levada Center&#8217;s regular polls</a> have consistently given him approval ratings of around 85% since the annexation of Crimea last year, which prompted a surge in patriotic feelings. Khodorkovsky remains to many a criminal and a western puppet (and a Jew, into the bargain). It also doesn&#8217;t help that he isn&#8217;t on speaking terms with Alexey Navalny, a more effective anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figure still in Russia. The only thing in his favor is the degree of moral authority that comes from having been a prisoner, then an exile (it worked for Lenin, after all).</p>\n<p>But there is a clear groundswell of discontent to tap into. Last month, truckers blocked roads across Russia in an unprecedented protest at a new levy on them&#8211;notionally to pay for the construction of new roads (the right to farm the tax was given without tender to Platon, a company part-owned by the son of Putin&#8217;s long-time judo partner, the sanctioned billionaire Arkady Rotenberg). The government was forced to back down.</p>\n<p>This week, there have been more signs of the disconnect between rulers and ruled, from the chilling to the farcical. Navalny and his collaborators published a long and detailed report (summarised in English <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/12/01/russia-s-mafia-state\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) alleging corruption in the family of Attorney General Yuri Chaika, who was justice minister during Khodorkovsky&#8217;s trial.</p>\n<p>In lighter vein, social media erupted in scorn as Federal Tourism Agency head Oleg Safonov said Russians didn&#8217;t need a beach holiday (in the wake of Putin ruling Turkey and Egypt, the two last affordable options for most Russians, out of bounds for political reasons). Safonov, who last year said he owned two villas in the Seychelles, instead urged people to vacation in Crimea (where the temperature is currently 51º Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>Russians are facing more hardship in 2016, when the economy is set to contract for the second year in a row, with no rebound in sight for the price of oil and gas, its biggest export earners. The ruble is now back near last year&#8217;s record low against the dollar. Real wages have fallen nearly 10% this year, as inflation has stuck above 15%. Manufacturing output is down nearly 6% on the year, while new car registrations were down 43% in November. The country&#8217;s largest automaker, Avtovaz, is preparing to switch to a 4-day week next month, according to labor officials. After falling for 10 years under Putin&#8217;s rule, poverty is set to increase for the fourth year in a row, according to Moscow&#8217;s Higher School of Economics.</p>\n<p>Khodorkovsky&#8217;s talk of a revolution may well be overblown, and he admits he has no chance of leading it. But of the economic woes that usually go before one, the signs are multiplying by the day.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"62\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4653461412001-62\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4653461412001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1SNV37a\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/features_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3D30oil%2Cbankofamerica%2Ccommodities%2Ccopper%2Cdevenparekh%2Cdriscoll%2Cedwardjones%2Cfutureofwork%2Cgold%2Cinvestorsroundtable%2Cinvestorsroundtable2015%2Cjameschanos%2Cjoshbrown%2Cjoshuambrown%2Ckatewarne%2Ckynikosassociates%2Coil%2Coilprices%2Csavitasubramanian%2Cshawn%2Csilver%2Cstockmarket%2Ctroweprice%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dfeatures%26topic%3Dfutureofwork&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>Hello friends and <em>Fortune</em> readers.</p>\n<p>Wall Street stock futures are higher as the world reacts positively to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s first interest rate hike in nine years (more below). The dollar is lower against the euro as traders &#8216;sell the fact&#8217; after &#8216;buying the rumor&#8217;, but stronger against the Chinese yuan.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/16/sheldon-adelson-bought-the-las-vegas-review-tribune/\" target=\"_blank\">must-read story</a> is from <em>Fortune</em>&#8216;s Dan Primack, who was first to report that billionaire casino owner and Republican party donor Sheldon Adelson is the mystery buyer of <em>The Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>. The identity of the buyer who paid $140 million for Nevada&#8217;s largest daily newspaper had been unclear for nearly a week.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what else you need to know today.</p>\n<p><strong>1. A frictionless lift-off</strong></p>\n<p>Stock markets have risen around the world in relief at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates. Markets have been happy to take at face value Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen&#8217;s interpretation of the hike as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy. The Fed assured investors that the central bank&#8217;s policy would remain accommodating as it raised rates from their longstanding stimulus level of near zero to 0.25%. Tokyo and Shanghai both rose more than 1.5%, while in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 was up nearly 3%. Commodity prices have suffered again, though, with gold approaching a 6-year low at $1,065/oz and crude oil back below $36 a barrel.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Putin admits to &#8216;military advisers&#8217; in Ukraine</strong></p>\n<p>President Vladimir Putin admitted for the first time that rebels in eastern Ukraine are being &#8216;advised&#8217; by Russians, something established beyond reasonable doubt a long time ago, but putting the seal on another 6-month extension of European sanctions against the country. Putin said the worst of Russia&#8217;s economic crisis is behind it but warned that there would probably be further budget cuts next year because the government&#8217;s oil price forecast, at $50 a barrel, is too high.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Rite Aid&#8217;s Q3 earnings</strong></p>\n<p>The drugstore operator reports third-quarter results after cutting its full-year earnings and sales forecasts earlier this year due to lower pharmacy reimbursements and expenses from its acquisition of EnvisionRx. Rite Aid <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"RAD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/rite-aid-117/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">RAD</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/27/walgreens-rite-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">agreed to be sold</a> to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"WBA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/walgreens-35/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">WBA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</span> for $9.4 billion in October and investors will be interested to hear updates on that deal, which likely faces a long road to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/05/walgreens-rite-aid-store-closings/\" target=\"_blank\">obtaining antitrust approval</a> as it would combine two of the country&#8217;s largest drugstore operators.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Weekly jobless claims</strong></p>\n<p>The Labor Department will release data on the number of Americans who submitted new applications for unemployment benefits last week. Weekly jobless claims are expected to have dipped to 275,000 last week, from 282,000 during the previous week. The steadily improving labor market has kept the number of weekly applications near historic lows for months.</p>\n<p><strong>5. <em>Star Wars</em> preview screenings</strong></p>\n<p>The most highly-anticipated film of the year officially opens nationwide on Friday, but <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> will first debut in various theaters across the country in special preview screenings. Fans with tickets to the advance screenings will get an early look at a movie that could become <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/just-how-much-will-the-new-star-wars-movie-make/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the highest-grossing films of all time</a>, according to several analyst predictions.

Sen. John McCain—one of the chief proponents of that ban—isn’t buying it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sen. McCain sent Defense Secretary Ash Carter a characteristically tersely-worded <a href=\"http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=417adfae-7803-4a04-b02c-e007bf0239f5\">letter</a> yesterday that accused the joint venture of manufacturing reasons for why it couldn&#8217;t compete for the launch. He described it as an effort to compel Congress to lift the ban on Russian engines. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McCain asked the Defense Department to halt regular subsidy payments made to the company to offset maintenance and infrastructure costs pending a review of its cost accounting systems. He also wants officials to evaluate the various assertions made by the partnership, known as United Launch Alliance (ULA), which </span><span class=\"s1\">until recently owned a monopoly on all Pentagon space launches.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“These assertions have major implications for both the DoD and the Congress, especially the clearly-established legislative priority to eliminate the DoD’s reliance on Russian-made rocket engines and whether the DoD should continue paying ULA a nearly $1 billion annual subsidy whether it actually launches satellites under the program or even chooses to compete for those launches,” McCain writes in the letter.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A quick backgrounder: Until Elon Musk’s SpaceX was certified to launch national security missions aboard its Falcon 9 rocket earlier this year, ULA was the Pentagon’s sole source of space launch services for national security satellites. ULA’s workhorse rocket, the Atlas V, requires a Russian-made engine known as the RD-180 to power its first stage. When Russia annexed Crimea in March of last year, Congress leveled a slew of economic sanctions against Russia, among them a ban on the import of Russian rocket engines for national security-related launches (commercial and scientific missions do not fall under the ban).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The ban exempted five RD-180 engines that were already on-order and paid for at the time the ban went into effect, offering ULA some flexibility in its launch manifest. But a home-grown RD-180 replacement engine sought by the U.S. Air Force won’t be ready until 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, ULA is more or less grounded without more RD-180s to power its Atlas V rockets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These circumstances have coalesced around ULA at a time when the Air Force has been trying to cultivate an expanded industrial base for space launch services. More competitors bidding on its launch contracts will drive down the cost of launch, the reasoning goes. It would also provide an important redundancy should technical issues or some other unforeseen event ground one of its launch partners.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By declining to bid on the launch–the first for which rival SpaceX was eligible to compete–ULA effectively cedes the contract to SpaceX, now the only company bidding for the business (the Air Force will formally award the contract early next year). Two factors drove the company&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the competition, according to ULA representatives. First, the company doesn&#8217;t have the correct contract accounting mechanisms in place to complete a compliant bid under the Air Force&#8217;s competitive bidding process. But the larger reason, company execs say, is that the company&#8217;s remaining stock of RD-180 engines has already been committed to other missions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his letter, McCain takes issue with both assertions, variously referring to them as “specious,” “dubious,” and &#8220;manufactured.&#8221; The Senator suggests that by declining to bid on the launch ULA is intentionally thwarting efforts to create competition in the launch market. The idea, McCain suggests, is to compel Congress to ease its sanctions and let ULA purchase the Russian rocket engines it wants.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“ULA’s use of these tactics is unacceptable,” McCain writes. “It artificially created a need for relief from legislative restrictions on its ability to continue using RD-180.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McCain’s major beef with ULA centers on its assigning of some of its remaining RD-180s to commercial missions not impacted by the ban. “Instead of setting those engines aside for national security launches, ULA rushed to assign them to non-national security launches that are unrestricted in their use of Russian engines,” McCain writes. “Put simply, there was no compelling reason to re-purpose DoD engines other than to attempt to compel Congress to award the Russian military-industrial base by easing sanctions targeted at Vladimir Putin and his cronies.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A letter is only a letter, but one from the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee could make a tangible impact on ULA. From the Defense Secretary, McCain wants an explanation—“with reference to source contractual documents”—as to when exactly ULA began assigning those Russian engines away from national security missions, and whether it was necessary to do so. He also wants an audit of ULA’s contractual accounting practices, and wants to withhold additional subsidy payments to the company—which stack up to nearly $1 billion annually—until he gets it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">ULA declined to comment for this story. The Defense Department did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>For more on the commercial space launch industry, watch this </em>Fortune<em> video.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"15\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4372811996001-15\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4372811996001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1XX8N6f\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcommerciallaunches%2Ccommercialrockets%2Ccommercialspaceflight%2Ccommercialspaceflightcompetition%2Ccommercialspaceflightmarket%2Cspaceflight%2Cspacex%2Cspacexlaunches%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dspacex&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script></p>\n",

              "title": "Putin's Nemesis Returns to Politics, Urging Russian Revolution",
              "content": "<p>Vladimir Putin&#8217;s biggest foe is returning to politics, saying that revolution in Russia is inevitable&#8211; and that he&#8217;s going to help bring it about.</p>\n<p>Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who served 10 years in prison after losing a titanic power struggle with Putin in 2003, told a conference in London Wednesday that the overthrow of Putin&#8217;s government is &#8220;inevitable and necessary&#8221; and that &#8220;I will certainly do my best to ensure that the rule of law is restored through a revolution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His words amount to a tearing-up of the peace deal he made with Putin when the latter pardoned him on the eve of the Sochi Winter Olympics. Khodorkovsky has been living in exile in the Netherlands since then. His comments appear to be a response Russian prosecutors, who summonsed him this week for questioning about the murder, in 1998, of a Siberian mayor who had accused his company of avoiding taxes. Khodorkovsky&#8217;s former security chief was convicted of that killing in 2007. Khodorkovsky has always denied ordering it.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s, Khodorkovsky had grabbed some of the juiciest bits of the Soviet Union&#8217;s oil sector and bundled them into what was at one time one of the world&#8217;s largest private oil companies, Yukos, ruthlessly abusing fellow-shareholders in the process. When he orchestrated opposition in parliament to Putin&#8217;s plans to squeeze more taxes out of the oil sector, he was arrested and convicted of embezzlement and tax evasion in a trial condemned internationally as rigged. Yukos was gobbled up by Rosneft, a state-controlled company embodying Putin&#8217;s strategy of bringing &#8216;strategic assets&#8217; back under state control after a corrupt privatization process in the 1990s (now 19.75% owned by BP Plc).</p>\n<p>The crushing of Khodorkovsky, which tamed the rest of his generation of oligarchs, was the defining moment in Putin&#8217;s ascendancy: a moment when the Russian state reasserted itself after a decade of chaos, to huge popular approval. Critics say instead of reducing corruption, it merely ushered in a new corrupt elite, one that has become bolder and more predatory as the easy flow of petrodollars has dried up.</p>\n<p>Khodorkovsky still faces huge obstacles to having an impact on his homeland (not least the vast disparity in resources between him and Putin&#8217;s regime). Opinion polls suggest a clear majority of Russians support &#8216;the good Tsar&#8217; Putin. <a href=\"http://www.levada.ru/eng/\" target=\"_blank\">Levada Center&#8217;s regular polls</a> have consistently given him approval ratings of around 85% since the annexation of Crimea last year, which prompted a surge in patriotic feelings. Khodorkovsky remains to many a criminal and a western puppet (and a Jew, into the bargain). It also doesn&#8217;t help that he isn&#8217;t on speaking terms with Alexey Navalny, a more effective anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figure still in Russia. The only thing in his favor is the degree of moral authority that comes from having been a prisoner, then an exile (it worked for Lenin, after all).</p>\n<p>But there is a clear groundswell of discontent to tap into. Last month, truckers blocked roads across Russia in an unprecedented protest at a new levy on them&#8211;notionally to pay for the construction of new roads (the right to farm the tax was given without tender to Platon, a company part-owned by the son of Putin&#8217;s long-time judo partner, the sanctioned billionaire Arkady Rotenberg). The government was forced to back down.</p>\n<p>This week, there have been more signs of the disconnect between rulers and ruled, from the chilling to the farcical. Navalny and his collaborators published a long and detailed report (summarised in English <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/12/01/russia-s-mafia-state\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) alleging corruption in the family of Attorney General Yuri Chaika, who was justice minister during Khodorkovsky&#8217;s trial.</p>\n<p>In lighter vein, social media erupted in scorn as Federal Tourism Agency head Oleg Safonov said Russians didn&#8217;t need a beach holiday (in the wake of Putin ruling Turkey and Egypt, the two last affordable options for most Russians, out of bounds for political reasons). Safonov, who last year said he owned two villas in the Seychelles, instead urged people to vacation in Crimea (where the temperature is currently 51º Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>Russians are facing more hardship in 2016, when the economy is set to contract for the second year in a row, with no rebound in sight for the price of oil and gas, its biggest export earners. The ruble is now back near last year&#8217;s record low against the dollar. Real wages have fallen nearly 10% this year, as inflation has stuck above 15%. Manufacturing output is down nearly 6% on the year, while new car registrations were down 43% in November. The country&#8217;s largest automaker, Avtovaz, is preparing to switch to a 4-day week next month, according to labor officials. After falling for 10 years under Putin&#8217;s rule, poverty is set to increase for the fourth year in a row, according to Moscow&#8217;s Higher School of Economics.</p>\n<p>Khodorkovsky&#8217;s talk of a revolution may well be overblown, and he admits he has no chance of leading it. But of the economic woes that usually go before one, the signs are multiplying by the day.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"16\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4653461412001-16\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4653461412001\"/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http://for.tn/1SNV37a\"/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=/8484/fort/video_bc/features_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3D30oil%2Cbankofamerica%2Ccommodities%2Ccopper%2Cdevenparekh%2Cdriscoll%2Cedwardjones%2Cfutureofwork%2Cgold%2Cinvestorsroundtable%2Cinvestorsroundtable2015%2Cjameschanos%2Cjoshbrown%2Cjoshuambrown%2Ckatewarne%2Ckynikosassociates%2Coil%2Coilprices%2Csavitasubramanian%2Cshawn%2Csilver%2Cstockmarket%2Ctroweprice%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dfeatures%26topic%3Dfutureofwork&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=timestamp\"/></object>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
